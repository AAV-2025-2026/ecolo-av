# Contributing to ecolo-av

How a change gets from your laptop into `main`. Everyone follows the same steps,
maintainers included.

New here? Set up your laptop first: [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) (30 minutes).

## The flow

| Step | What you do | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fork the repo and clone your fork | once |
| 2 | Open or pick an issue | GitHub |
| 3 | Make a branch from the team's `main` | your laptop |
| 4 | Commit in small steps | your laptop |
| 5 | Push the branch to your fork | your fork |
| 6 | Open a pull request to `AAV-2025-2026/ecolo-av` | GitHub |
| 7 | Get one approval and green CI | GitHub |
| 8 | Add it to the merge queue | GitHub |
| 9 | Delete the branch, sync your fork | both |

Nobody pushes to the team's `main`. The merge queue is the only way in.

## 1. Fork and clone (once)

A fork is your own copy of the repo on GitHub. You push there; the team's repo only
changes through pull requests.

1. Put an SSH key on your GitHub account ([GitHub's guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)).
2. On https://github.com/AAV-2025-2026/ecolo-av, click **Fork**, then **Create fork**.
3. Clone your fork and point `upstream` at the team's repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/ecolo-av.git ~/ecolo-av
cd ~/ecolo-av
git remote add upstream https://github.com/AAV-2025-2026/ecolo-av.git
git remote -v
```

| Remote | Is | You |
|---|---|---|
| `origin` | your fork | push here |
| `upstream` | the team's repo | fetch from here, never push |

## 2. Issues

Every piece of work starts as an issue, so the team can see who is doing what.

**Open one:** Issues, then **New issue**.

| Part | Write |
|---|---|
| Title | the problem or the goal, in a few words: "Spine ignores a stale heartbeat" |
| Body | what is wrong or wanted, why it matters, and how we know it's done |
| Task | the proposal's task number, if there is one: `T3.6` |
| Assignee | yourself, when you start on it |

**Close one:**

| How | When |
|---|---|
| Write `Closes #12` in the pull request | the work is done: GitHub closes the issue when the PR merges |
| **Close issue**, then **Close as not planned**, with a comment saying why | the work won't happen, or it's a duplicate (link the other issue) |

Don't close someone else's issue without asking them.

## 3. Branches

Always start from the team's latest `main`, never from your fork's old one:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git switch -c t3.6-spine-heartbeat upstream/main
```

| Rule | Example |
|---|---|
| Name: task number, then a few words, lowercase, hyphens | `t3.6-spine-heartbeat`, `t4.4-rs485-reader` |
| No task number: say the kind of change | `fix-gps-heading-sign`, `docs-car-install` |
| One branch, one change, one pull request | a fix and an unrelated refactor are two branches |
| Never commit to `main`, even in your fork | `main` only follows `upstream/main` |

Branch still open while `main` moves on? Bring it up to date:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

On a conflict, git stops and names the files. Fix them, `git add` them, then
`git rebase --continue`. Stuck: `git rebase --abort` puts everything back. More help:
[Git](docs/git.md), "Conflicts during a rebase".

A rebase rewrites your branch, so a plain `git push` of an already-pushed branch is
refused. Push it with `git push --force-with-lease`: to your fork's branch only, never
to `main`.

## 4. Commits

Each commit is one logical change that still builds and passes the tests.

### The message

```
Stop the spine when the Orin's heartbeat is stale

The spine kept the last command for up to 2 s after the Orin went
quiet. It now brakes after 100 ms without a heartbeat (proposal 3.4),
and a test covers the timeout.

Closes #12
```

| Part | Rule |
|---|---|
| Subject | what the commit does, as a command: "Add", "Fix", "Remove", not "Added" or "Fixes" |
| Subject length | 72 characters at most; no full stop at the end |
| Blank line | between the subject and the body |
| Body | **why**: the problem, the reason for this fix, anything a reviewer can't see in the diff |
| Body width | wrap at 72 characters |
| Footer | `Closes #12` when the commit finishes an issue |

| Good subject | Bad subject |
|---|---|
| `Fix the GPS heading sign for west-facing starts` | `fix` |
| `Add the RS-485 reader for the Junctek monitor` | `stuff`, `WIP`, `asdf` |
| `Move vehicle limits into vehicle.yaml` | `Updated files` |

### What goes in a commit

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| run `tools/test.sh` before every commit | commit something that fails the tests |
| keep each commit to one change | mix a fix, a rename and a format pass |
| update `PROVENANCE.md` when you change inherited code | copy old code without saying where from |
| change `docs/interfaces.yaml` first when a topic changes | change a topic without the contract |
| give a new or changed feature its row in `docs/features.md`, in the same commit | leave the features table behind |
| give a new `pixi run` task its row in README.md's "Every command" | add a task nobody can find |
| changed `docs/*.md`? run `pixi run docs` and commit the HTML | let the web pages drift from the markdown |
| | commit `build/`, `install/`, `log/`, `target/` or `.pixi/` |
| | commit keys, passwords, tokens or `.env` files: the repo is public |
| | commit large data files: add a download step instead |
| | add attribution lines (`Co-Authored-By`, "Generated with"): the README's Credits say who did what |

Made a mess before pushing? `git commit --amend` fixes the last commit.

## 5. Push to your fork

First run the full `pixi run test`: it adds the build, the style check and `colcon test`,
which `tools/test.sh` skips. Then:

```bash
git push -u origin t3.6-spine-heartbeat
```

After the first push, `git push` is enough (after a rebase: `git push --force-with-lease`,
section 3). Once someone is reviewing, add new commits
instead of rewriting old ones, so they can see what changed.

## 6. Pull requests

**Open one:** after a push, GitHub shows **Compare & pull request** on your fork. Check
that it says `AAV-2025-2026/ecolo-av` `main` ← `<you>/ecolo-av` `<your-branch>`. Or:

```bash
gh pr create --repo AAV-2025-2026/ecolo-av --base main
```

Not finished but want feedback? Open it as a **draft**, then **Ready for review** later.

The description box fills in with our template. Replace every comment in it.

### Writing a good pull request

| Section | Write | Leave out |
|---|---|---|
| Title | what `main` gains, as a command, 72 characters at most. It becomes the commit subject on `main` | "Update", "Changes", a branch name |
| What and why | the problem, and why this is the fix, in 2 to 4 sentences | a list of every file |
| Issue / task | `Closes #12`, `Task: T3.6` | |
| How I tested | the exact commands you ran and what happened; say what you did **not** test | "tested, works" |
| Risk | what could break, and on which machine: laptop, sim or car | |
| Screenshots | for the HUD, RViz or anything visual | |
| Checklist | tick only what you actually did | ticking everything by habit |

Keep a pull request small enough to review in 15 minutes: one change, a few hundred
lines at most. Split anything bigger.

## 7. Review

A pull request merges only when all of these are true:

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| 1 approval from someone other than the author | a second pair of eyes on every change |
| CI green: `linux`, `arm` and `car-kit` | it builds and passes `pixi run test` on a laptop's and the car's computers |
| every review comment resolved | questions get answered, not skipped |
| approval given after the last push | a new push needs a new approval |

Your first pull request from a fork: a maintainer may need to click **Approve and run
workflows** before CI starts.

**Reviewing someone else's:** read the description first, then the diff. Check that the
tests cover the change, that names and topics follow [Conventions](docs/conventions.md),
and that nothing secret or generated is committed. Ask questions as comments; approve
only what you understand.

## 8. The merge queue

When the pull request is approved and green, click **Merge when ready**. The queue then:

1. puts your change on top of the latest `main` and the pull requests ahead of it;
2. runs CI on that combination;
3. merges it if CI passes, as one squashed commit: your title as the subject, your
   commit messages as the body;
4. takes it out of the queue if CI fails, and tells you. Fix it, push, and add it again.

So two changes that each pass alone, but break together, never reach `main`. Nobody
needs to keep rebasing or wait for each other.

## 9. After the merge

Delete the branch and bring your fork's `main` up to date:

```bash
git switch main
git fetch upstream
git merge --ff-only upstream/main
git push origin main
git branch -D t3.6-spine-heartbeat
git push origin --delete t3.6-spine-heartbeat
```

`-D` (capital) is needed because the squash gave `main` a new commit, so git can't tell
the branch was merged. Check the pull request says **Merged** first.

## Rules on `main`

| Rule | |
|---|---|
| No direct pushes, admins included | changes arrive through the merge queue |
| No force pushes, no deletion | `main`'s history is never rewritten |
| Tags can't be moved or deleted | `pre-aav-merge` stays a reliable backup |
