# spine-esp32-umod

## Overview

The spine on today's control board: the SparkFun ESP32 MicroMod (the original ESP32,
Xtensa) on the AAV carrier, beside the Motor-Pi. The Rust replacement for
`firmware/legacy/aav_umod_esp32`. **Never flashed yet.** The C++ stays until this is proven
on the car.

It only moves pins: the deciding is in `spine-core`, the devices in `spine-board`.

## Interface

### What it does

| Part | How |
|---|---|
| The brain | `spine-core`, every 10 ms |
| The devices | `spine-board`: two Jrk G2s, the DAC, the PCA9555, on I2C 21/22 at 100 kHz |
| Commands | the Motor-Pi's frames on GPIO16 (default: version 2, 17 bytes, with the Orin's heartbeat; 13-byte version 1 with `link-v1`), or CAN on TWAI (`can`) |
| RC override | iBUS on GPIO32 |
| Speed | none on this board: open loop |
| Watchdog | TIMG1, 100 ms |
| Log | the USB cable: a `STATUS` line every 200 ms, an event line at each change, an `FSM` line with the five state regions (`spine_core::fsm`) and a `LINK` line with the frame counts, with each `STATUS`; a `TICK` line once a second: the worst gap between ticks and the overruns, the timing test's baseline. With `json-log`: the JSON status lines instead (`firmware/status`) |

The pin map is `src/pins.rs` (and `docs/rust-firmware.md`).

| GPIO | Use |
|---|---|
| 16 | UART1 RX, 115200 8N1: the Motor-Pi's frames |
| 17 | UART1 TX: the uplink, only with `uplink` (the wire is unconfirmed, TODO 50) |
| 32 | UART2 RX: the RC receiver's iBUS |
| 21, 22 | I2C SDA, SCL: Jrk steering 0x05, Jrk brake 0x04, DAC 0x0C, PCA9555 0x20 |
| 2, 18, 19, 14 | the status LED; the carrier's red, green, blue LEDs |
| 25, 26 | TWAI TX, RX with `can`: **a guess**, see `src/pins.rs` |
| 27 | the e-stop's spare contact with `estop-input`: **a guess** (Q6) |

The direction output is pin P00 of the PCA9555, not an ESP32 pin.

### Features

| Feature | Use |
|---|---|
| `legacy-uart` (default) | today: a drop-in for the C++, with `aav_legacy`'s `legacy_uart_bridge` |
| `link-v1` | with `legacy-uart`: the 2025-26 13-byte frame, no heartbeat (`frame_version: 1`) |
| `uplink` | with `legacy-uart`: a status frame back to the Motor-Pi every 20 ms (version 3 since 1 Nov: with both Jrks' positions in counts and the steering calibration's state), and the three-position RC mode switch. Off until the hardware lead confirms the wire |
| `can` | the KEFC plan: `firmware/can/aav.dbc`. Its pins are unknown: see `src/pins.rs` |
| `estop-input` | the e-stop's spare contact on GPIO27, once wired (Q6) |
| `qemu` | runs in Espressif's QEMU, never on the car: stand-in I2C devices, a busy-wait tick |
| `json-log` | the JSON status lines (`firmware/status`: `hb`, `status` 5 a second, `event`) on the USB cable in place of the text lines, 96 bytes a tick so the print never waits |
| `wifi-status` | **off by default; read only.** Joins a WiFi and serves the status page, `/status.json`, `/scan` and a WebSocket of the status lines (10 a second). Below: "WiFi status". Not with `qemu` |

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `src/main.rs` | the settings, the board glue, the loop, the logs |
| `src/pins.rs` | the pin map, the one list |
| `src/can.rs` | TWAI (CAN) at 500 kbit/s, 11-bit IDs, bus-off recovery every 1 s |
| `src/report.rs` | the status lines from what the tick already has (`json-log`, `wifi-status`) |
| `src/wifi.rs` | the WiFi station, its web server and WebSocket (`wifi-status`) |
| `page.html` | the status page `wifi-status` serves: graphs of steering, brake and throttle |
| `src/wifi_secrets.rs.example` | copy it to `src/wifi_secrets.rs` (git ignores it) for `wifi-status` |
| `build.rs` | the build's commit and features for the `hb` line; the WiFi credentials' copy |
| `rust-toolchain.toml` | the `esp` toolchain |

## Invariants

- **The red button always stops the car**, whatever this program does (Ben). It stays
  wired as it is; the program only reads a spare contact. No output is in its path.
- **Safe after any reset:** `SpineBoard::init` puts the throttle at 0 and the brake on;
  `spine-core` boots latched and drives only after a stop, then a drive command.
- **Exactly one link:** `legacy-uart` or `can`. Wrong mixes are `compile_error!`s
  (`link-v1` or `uplink` without `legacy-uart`, `qemu` with `can`).
- **The heartbeat (TODO 50):** with version 2, a frame whose counter hasn't changed isn't
  a command. 100 ms after the counter stops, the spine brakes, cuts the throttle and
  latches, however many frames still arrive.
- The tick is 10 ms and the watchdog 100 ms: `spine-core` expects them.
- The CAN IDs are `firmware/can/aav.dbc`'s, through `spine_core::protocol`.
- Pins live here and in `docs/rust-firmware.md`: change both together. ROS never sees one.
- Leave `estop-input` off until it is wired: a floating input would trip at random.
- **Reporting never steers.** `json-log` and `wifi-status` only read what the tick already
  has; they read no device for it (reading a Jrk's errors clears them) and change no input.
- **`wifi-status` is read only:** no path takes a command, a setting or a firmware update.
  It is off by default, and the car-day build (`tools/car_day_build.sh`) leaves it off.
- **The tick never waits on the WiFi**: lines are handed over without waiting, and a slow
  reader loses lines (a gap in `seq`), never time. The timing test below is the proof.
- **The WiFi's password is never in git, a log or a line.** It lives only in
  `src/wifi_secrets.rs` (git ignores it) and in the build's `target/` copy. A `wifi-status`
  ELF holds it: never publish one. The inherited repos' old passwords are public: never
  reuse one (Q34).

## Side Effects

- Drives the steering and brake Jrk G2s, the throttle DAC and the direction pin: it moves
  the car. Bench only, wheels off the ground (`docs/esp32-bench.md`).
- Reads UART1 (Motor-Pi) and UART2 (iBUS); with `uplink`, writes UART1 TX.
- With `can`: sends and receives on the CAN bus through TWAI.
- Writes logs to UART0 (the USB cable); drives the four LEDs.
- The hardware watchdog resets the chip if a tick hangs.
- With `wifi-status`: the radio, as a WiFi station; a web server on port 80; with `/scan`,
  zero-length I2C writes to 0x01 to 0x77, 4 a tick, only while stopped and not armed.

## Verification

```sh
pixi run esp tools        # once: Espressif's Rust, espup, espflash (needs rustup)
pixi run esp build        # or: --no-default-features --features can
pixi run esp qemu-check   # in QEMU: it brakes within 0.2 s when the heartbeat stops
pixi run esp flash        # bench only, wheels off the ground: docs/esp32-bench.md
```

It is a workspace of its own: it builds only for `xtensa-esp32-none-elf`, with the `esp`
toolchain (`rust-toolchain.toml`). `tools/test.sh` runs `tools/esp32.sh check` and the
QEMU check, where that toolchain is installed. The check runs `cargo fmt`, one build, and
clippy on eight feature mixes:

| Checked | Never checked |
|---|---|
| the default; `can,estop-input`; `qemu`; `link-v1`; `uplink`; `qemu,uplink`; `json-log`; `json-log,wifi-status` (with the example's made-up credentials) | `link-v1` with `uplink`; `can` without `estop-input`; `estop-input` on the UART link; `json-log` in QEMU (tried by hand, 7 Nov) |

The logic is tested on a laptop: `cd firmware/spine && cargo test`.

## Settings

In `src/main.rs`:

| Constant | Set to | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `TICK`, `WATCHDOG_MS` | 10 ms, 100 ms | as the Pico 2 program; `spine-core` expects them |
| `I2C_KHZ` | 100 | as the C++ |
| `FULL_THROTTLE_SPEED` | 3.0 m/s | the open loop's scale; `legacy.yaml`'s guess (Q4) |
| `IDLE_BRAKE` | 1.0 | the C++ kept the brake on while nobody drives; Ben decides |

What differs from the C++, and what Ben must decide: `docs/rust-firmware.md`.

## WiFi status (`wifi-status`)

Read only, off by default, **never flashed yet**. The plan's step 8
(`docs/designs/2026-11-07_esp32-debug-link_brief.md`): only after the timing test below.

| Path, port 80 | Gives |
|---|---|
| `/` | `page.html`: steering, brake and throttle graphs (asked, position, low to high), pause, a window, a line filter |
| `/status.json` | the latest `status` line (`{}` before the first) |
| `/scan` | starts an I2C scan if none is going; `{"scan":"running","found":[4,5]}`. It waits while armed or driving |
| `/ws` | a WebSocket: every line, as text; two clients at most; a slow one loses lines |

### Set it up

1. Ask the hardware lead for the bench WiFi's name and password. Never use the ones in the
   inherited repos (Q34).
2. `cp src/wifi_secrets.rs.example src/wifi_secrets.rs`, and put them there. Git ignores
   that file. Without it the build stops with a `compile_error!` that says this.
3. `pixi run esp build --features wifi-status` (add `json-log` to see the lines on the cable
   too). Never share that ELF: it holds the password.
4. Try the page first without a board: `python3 tools/esp32_status_sim.py`, then open
   <http://127.0.0.1:8765/>. On the board: `http://<its address>/` (its log says it).

### Sizes (7 Nov, built, not flashed)

| Build | App image | RAM, static |
|---|---|---|
| default | 143 KB | 197 KB (data 8.6 KB + bss 188 KB) |
| `json-log` | 150 KB | 197 KB |
| `wifi-status` | 736 KB of the 4 MB partition | 197 KB (data 17.5 KB + bss 179 KB, with the radio's 72 KB heap) |

The crates: `esp-radio` 1.0.0-beta.1 (WiFi), `esp-alloc` 0.11 (its heap), `embassy-net`
0.9.1, `picoserve` 0.20.1 (HTTP and WebSocket). They resolve with esp-hal 1.2.2 and
esp-rtos 0.4.0 as they are; `build-std` builds `alloc` too.

## Bench test: the tick's timing with the radio

The radio shares the chip with the tick. These steps measure whether it costs the tick
time. Wheels off the ground, the hardware lead there (`docs/esp32-bench.md`). Read
`worst_gap_us` and `overruns` (the `TICK` text line, or `tick` in a `status` line); write
each row down.

| # | Build and state | Watch for | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | default build, no radio, 10 min | the baseline | write the numbers down |
| 2 | `json-log`, 10 min | the cable log's own cost | `worst_gap_us` within 2 ms of step 1 |
| 3 | `json-log,wifi-status`, joined, no client, 10 min | the radio idle | no watchdog reset; `overruns` 0 |
| 4 | the same, the page open on a laptop, 30 min | a client streaming | `overruns` 0; `seq` gaps only if the WiFi is weak |
| 5 | the same, two clients, plus `/scan` every 10 s (disarmed) | the most load | `worst_gap_us` under 30 ms (the proposed pass number: the review, B7) |
| 6 | the router switched off for 1 min, then on, with the page open | the WiFi going away and back | no reset, no `overruns`; it joins again by itself, the page reconnects |
| 7 | step 4, armed, with the Pi's frames | the scan waits | `/scan` says "paused"; no I2C fault |

If any step fails, `wifi-status` stays off: the cable (`json-log`) carries the lines.
