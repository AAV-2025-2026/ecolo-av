//! What a board crate provides: the parts that differ from chip to chip.
//!
//! A future ESP32, Pico 2 or STM32 crate implements [`Board`], and hands over its
//! I2C bus and the RC receiver's serial port. Everything else is in this crate and
//! is the same on every board.
//!
//! | Board part | Why it differs |
//! |---|---|
//! | the clock | each chip has its own timers |
//! | the hardware e-stop input | which pin, and whether it reads high or low when the loop is open |
//! | the wheel encoder counter | an interrupt, or the chip's own counter: PIO on a Pico 2, PCNT on an ESP32, a timer on an STM32 |
//! | the CAN controller | built into an ESP32 (TWAI) or an STM32; a Pico 2 needs a separate chip, such as an MCP2515 |
//!
//! The I2C bus and the serial port are not here: every chip's HAL already implements
//! `embedded-hal`'s `I2c` and `embedded-io`'s `Read`.
