//! Which of the car's four I2C devices answer, once at boot: for the bench's first look.
//!
//! Read only. Each device gets a probe with no data (a zero-length write: it acknowledges
//! or not, and nothing in it changes), as [`BusScan`](crate::BusScan) does. Each Jrk that
//! answers is then asked its feedback mode, a RAM setting (`JrkG2::feedback_mode`): that
//! read clears nothing. The error registers are never read here: reading them clears
//! them (0xB3, 0xB5).
//!
//! Four probes and two one-byte reads: about 1 ms at 100 kHz, well inside the watchdog.
