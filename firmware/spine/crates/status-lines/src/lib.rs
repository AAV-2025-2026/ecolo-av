//! |---|---|---|
//! | `hb` | [`Heartbeat`] | once a second |
//! | `status` | [`Status`] | 5 to 20 times a second |
//! | `event` | [`Event`] | at each change |
//! | `health` | [`Health`] | once a second: the Pi link's verdict, the devices, the faults |
//! | `config` | [`Config`] | at boot and every 10 s: the build and the numbers it runs with |
//! | `devices` | [`DeviceList`] | at boot and every 10 s: which I2C devices answered at boot |
//!
//! A [`Line`] is one of them with its `seq` and `up_ms`. It is [`Display`](core::fmt::Display),
//! so it can go straight to a log, or into a fixed buffer with [`Line::write_to`] or a
//! [`LineBuf`] for a socket. Nothing allocates. [`Spread`] keeps the lowest and highest
//! device values between two status lines; [`Trickle`] hands lines to a slow serial log a
//! few bytes a tick.
//!
//! The lines are built from values the tick already has: this crate reads nothing.
//! `golden.jsonl` beside the contract is the test: every line here is checked against it
//! byte for byte.
