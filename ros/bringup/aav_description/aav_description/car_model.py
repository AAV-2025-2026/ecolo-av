"""
The car model: how the car answers a command.

Shared by ego (its lead and its trace), the simulators (Gazebo's adapter) and the drivers'
tests. No ROS here.

Moved here from aav_gazebo's actuator_model.py on 7 Nov (release 0.3), so ego and the
simulators use one model; `aav_gazebo.actuator_model` still re-exports every name. Its Rust
twin is the car-model crate beside this package (car-model/, the same maths, checked by
the shared vectors car-model/vectors.json: gen_vectors.py writes them from this file).

Two ways in:

  - step(cfg, state, command, dt) -> CarState, and predict(cfg, state, commands, dt,
    horizon) -> [CarState]: the pure model, with dead times and the kinematic bicycle on
    top (x, y, yaw). ego's trace is predict's list.
  - Actuators(cfg, loop): the same step held in an object, as gazebo_adapter steps it at
    50 Hz (Gazebo's time) and sends Gazebo the speed and steering it gives
    (docs/full-simulation.md, option A):

    ego's speed ──> SpeedLoop ──> throttle %, brake % ──> Actuators ──> speed  ──> Gazebo
    ego's angle ─────────────────────────────────────> Actuators ──> angle  ──> Gazebo

  - SpeedLoop: a stand-in for the spine's speed loop (spine-core speed_loop.rs), with its
    gains, until the spine itself runs in the loop (step 4). Its profiles ('default',
    'smooth': TODO 27) are spine-core's; firmware/spine/speed_loop_vectors.txt checks both.
  - Actuators: throttle % -> acceleration, brake % -> deceleration, coasting drag; the
    steering motor's speed limit, the linkage's lag, the centre offset and a deadband.
    Its numbers are vehicle.yaml's `actuators:` section (guesses until tests 3.10-3.12
    and 4.1-4.5 in docs/tests.md).
  - Ideal: the old behaviour, for comparison (actuator_model:=false): the speed follows
    the command within Gazebo's old limits (+1.5 / -3.0 m/s^2), the steering at once.

With the spine in the loop (sim.launch.py spine:=true, step 4), the spine's own speed
loop runs in spine_sim (spine-core, Rust), and its throttle, brake, gear and steering
target go straight to Actuators.drive, skipping SpeedLoop:

    spine_sim ──> throttle %, brake %, reverse, steering target ──> Actuators.drive ──> Gazebo

The maths of one step of dt (docs/vehicle-model.md, "One car model"):

  1. Dead time: each input waits n = floor(dead_time / dt + 0.5) steps in a delay line
     (throttle with its gear, brake, steering target). 0 (the default): no wait.
  2. Throttle and brake: each level follows its input with a first-order lag,
     level' = (u - level) / lag, stepped exactly: level += (u - level)(1 - e^(-dt/lag)).
  3. Speed: v += max_accel * share * throttle (0 below throttle_deadband, - in reverse) * dt;
     then (max_brake * share * brake + drag * |v|) * dt is taken off |v|, never past 0 (the
     brake and drag stop the car, they never reverse it). share = mass / (mass + payload):
     the same motor and brakes push a heavier car less (a = F / m; ego's dynamics.py
     load_share). max_accel and max_brake are the empty car's; payload 0 gives share 1.
  4. Steering: the motor's setpoint takes the target only when it differs by more than
     steer_deadband; the motor moves toward it at most steer_rate * dt; the linkage lags
     the motor (steer_lag); the wheels' angle is that plus steer_offset, within
     +-max_steering.
  5. Bicycle (base_link on the rear axle): yaw += v tan(steer) / wheelbase * dt, then
     x += v cos(yaw_mid) dt, y += v sin(yaw_mid) dt, with yaw_mid halfway between the
     step's old and new yaw; v and steer are the step's new ones.

Units: m/s, m/s^2, rad, s. Throttle and brake are 0..1. Positive steering turns left.
