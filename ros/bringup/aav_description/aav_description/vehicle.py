    - the local costmap's lidar_layer, only with the lidar: a layer that is there but
      disabled still subscribes to its topic;
    - with `ghost` (aav_ghost), the ghost as one more source, and its own layer,
      ghost_layer: it only adds a pretend obstacle, never clears the real sensors' marks;
    - with `radar` or `lidar` and `plan_around`, the same sensor layers in the planner's
      costmap too, so it plans round what they see (the ghost stays out: the car must stop
      for it). Without plan_around the planner sees only the map, and the car stops for
      what's in its way: the stop zone's tests;
    - the planner (PLANNERS; hybrid when none is named, as it needs no `lattice_file`;
      the launch files always name one, as default_planner(reversing) picks): its
      block (PLANNER_BLOCKS) becomes GridBased, the name the behaviour trees ask for, and
      the spare blocks go. lattice also takes
      `lattice_file` (the primitives) and, with `reversing`, may expand backwards;
    - with `voxels` and `lidar` (aav_voxels, a trial): the lidar_layer reads the cubes and
      the road they saw (sources voxels, voxels_ground) instead of the scan, and
      collision_monitor's voxels source takes the lidar's place.
