"""
One launch for every target: target:= picks who plays the car, and so the profile.

  ros2 launch aav_bringup stack.launch.py target:=turtle|gazebo|bench|car|carla
      [source:=]  [any argument of that target's own file, such as world:=road, machine:=orin]

  target   starts             source (where the sensor data comes from)
  turtle   turtle.launch.py   sim
  gazebo   sim.launch.py      sim
  bench    bench.launch.py    bench
  car      car.launch.py      real
  carla    carla.launch.py    sim

source:= may only say the target's own: the real car only ever runs on real data, and a
simulator never drives on real sensors. The sensor mux and the output mux (aav_io_mux)
check the same while it runs, so a wrong mix that slips past here still can't move the
car. The `pixi run` tasks (turtle, sim, bench, car) start the same files directly.
