"""
ego's lead: ask a little ahead, so the slow actuators answer about when the driver wanted.

No ROS imports, so the tests run anywhere. The node: ego_node.py; the page:
docs/vehicle-model.md, "ego's lead".

The car's actuators answer late: the throttle, brake and steering each wait their dead time,
then follow with a first-order lag (aav_description car_model.py). For a lag T, the lead

    u = f + T df/dt,   f = the driver's request through a filter of time constant tf

is (1 + T s) / (1 + tf s): the actuator's 1 / (1 + T s) after it leaves 1 / (1 + tf s).
The car then answers as if its lag were filter_time instead of T. A dead time can't be
undone (it would need the future), so it counts as lag: T = dead_time + lag
(e^(-s Td) is about 1 / (1 + Td s)). Each T comes from the car model's numbers:

    | Lead        | T                                   |
    |-------------|-------------------------------------|
    | speeding up | throttle_dead_time + throttle_lag   |
    | slowing     | brake_dead_time + brake_lag         |
    | steering    | steer_dead_time + steer_lag         |

The steering motor's rate limit (steer_rate) is not a lag: no lead undoes it.

Safety (ego stays a safety lock):

  - The lead runs before ego's limits: max_speed, the reverse limit, the steering limit and
    rate, the slews, the jerk and the body's caps all still apply to what it gives.
  - Each lead is at most max_speed_lead (m/s) and max_steer_lead (rad).
  - It never turns a forward request into a reverse one, or back.
  - It never softens a slow-down: while slowing, the speed is never above the request.
  - A stop (no fresh command) gets no lead at all.

When (lead_wanted): lag_lead off - never; auto - in a simulator only (use_sim_time),
because the car's numbers are guesses until tests 3.10-3.12 and 4.1-4.5; on - on the car
too, once those are measured. And never while a lag-aware driver drives (it already
leads for the lag itself: two leads would ask twice): LagAwareWatch tells.
