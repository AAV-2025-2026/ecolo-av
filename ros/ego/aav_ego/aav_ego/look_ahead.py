"""
The squiggly line's maths: the plan beside the trace, and the room left at the stop point.

No ROS imports, so the tests run anywhere. The node look_ahead (look_ahead_node.py) turns
these into /ego/plan_ahead and /ego/ahead for every screen (docs/hud.md, "The squiggly
line"). Every point here is (x, y) in base_link: the car at (0, 0), facing +x.

    the plan (in base_link) ──▶ crop_ahead ──▶ the faint line: what the planner WANTS
    the trace + the plan    ──▶ gap        ──▶ how far the bold line (what the car WILL do)
                                              strays from it: green, amber, red
    the stop point + plan   ──▶ to_goal    ──▶ m from the stop point to the plan's end
    the stop point + grid   ──▶ first_hit  ──▶ m from the stop point to the first obstacle
