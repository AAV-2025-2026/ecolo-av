# aav_costmap

Our own costmaps, in Rust: Nav2's `costmap_2d` layers ported, run **beside** Nav2's
costmaps as a trial (`costmap:=own`). Nav2 stays the default, and on the car.
The page: [docs/own-costmap.md](../../../docs/own-costmap.md).

```
/map, the scan (and radar, cubes, cameras where they run), odometry, /tf_static
  -> costmap -> /drivers/nav/costmap/local (+ _raw)   odom, 20 m window, 5 Hz
             -> /drivers/nav/costmap/global (+ _raw)  map, the map's size, 1 Hz
  local_raw -> mppi_lag (tracker:=mppi_lag), instead of Nav2's /local_costmap/costmap_raw
```

## Overview

| Part | What it is |
|---|---|
| `crates/costmap` | the maths, no ROS: grid, static map, obstacle layers, inflation, the layered costmap |
| `crates/costmap-node` | the ROS node, binary `costmap` (rclrs): messages in and out only |

```sh
pixi run sim costmap:=own tracker:=mppi_lag
pixi run sim-check --costmap own --tracker mppi_lag --lidar-obstacle --plan-around
```

## Interface

**`costmap`** (`crates/costmap-node/src/main.rs`), started by `aav_navigation`'s
`navigation.launch.py costmap:=own`

| Item | What |
|---|---|
| Subscribes | `/map` (transient local); `/localization/odom/local`; `/tf` (map -> odom); `/tf_static` (sensor mounts); each layer's sources from nav2.yaml (`/sensors/lidar/scan`; the radar, cubes, camera points and ghost where they run), best effort |
| Publishes | `/drivers/nav/costmap/local`, `/global` (OccupancyGrid); `/drivers/nav/costmap/local_raw`, `/global_raw` (nav2_msgs/Costmap); `/drivers/nav/costmap/status` (DiagnosticStatus) |
| Serves | `/drivers/nav/costmap/clear_entirely_local`, `_global` (nav2_msgs/srv/ClearEntireCostmap): forget every mark. With `tracker:=mppi_lag`, `bt_navigator`'s local clear is remapped here |
| Parameters | `local`, `global`: one JSON block each, made by `aav_description`'s `vehicle.costmap_params` from the tuned nav2.yaml; `odom_topic`, `map_topic`, `base_frame`, the topic names |

## Invariants

- The same input as Nav2's: the launch file builds both from the same tuned nav2.yaml.
- Nav2's cost codes and its 0-100 table; Nav2's message types on `*_raw`.
- No ROS in `crates/costmap`; no maths in the node.
- `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` clean.

## Side Effects

- Publishes the topics above and serves the two clear services. Nothing else.

## Verification

```sh
cargo test -p costmap                                  # the layers and hand-made scenes
cargo run --release -p costmap --example timing        # how long an update takes
pixi run build && colcon test --packages-select aav_costmap
```
