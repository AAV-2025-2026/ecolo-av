//! Our own costmap: Nav2's `costmap_2d` layers, ported to Rust, with no ROS.
//!
//! | Module | Nav2's |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`cost`] | the cost codes, and `Costmap2DPublisher`'s table to an `OccupancyGrid` |
//! | [`grid`] | `Costmap2D`: cells, `updateOrigin` (the rolling window), `raytraceLine` |
//! | [`footprint`] | `footprint.cpp`: the padded outline, its inscribed radius, its cells |
//! | [`static_layer`] | `StaticLayer`: the map's cells, read as free, lethal or unknown |
//! | [`obstacle`] | `ObstacleLayer`: marks the sensors' points, clears along each ray |
//! | [`inflation`] | `InflationLayer`: the cost falling away from each lethal cell |
//! | [`layered`] | `LayeredCostmap`: the layers in order, into one grid |
//!
//! The node (`costmap-node`) only moves messages in and out of a [`Costmap`].
