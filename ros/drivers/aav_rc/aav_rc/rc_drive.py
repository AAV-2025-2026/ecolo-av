"""
The RC transmitter as a ROS driver (TODO 48): its sticks to a command. No ROS here.

  the ESP32 reads the receiver ─uplink─> legacy_uart_bridge ─/vehicle/rc─> RcDrive
       ─> (v, w) ─/drivers/rc/cmd_vel─> twist_mux (priority 95) ─> ego ─> the output mux
       ─> the Motor Pi's frames, with the Orin's counter ─> the ESP32 drives

The transmitter's mode switch (CH6; the three positions are a proposal: docs/decisions.md):

  computer     the computer drives (Nav2, ...)               this driver: nothing
  RC via ROS   a person, with the sticks, through ego         a command every tick, zeros
                                                              too: nothing below it drives
  RC direct    a person, straight from the ESP32 (fallback)   nothing: the ESP32 ignores
                                                              the computer then
  no signal    nobody: the ESP32 brakes (fault 256)           nothing

Leaving RC via ROS: one zero, then nothing (as teleop_twist_joy does on its deadman).
/vehicle/rc gone quiet while on RC via ROS: zeros, a stop, until it comes back; the
person can still take over with RC direct, which needs no computer.

The sticks mean what they mean in RC direct (ibus RcMap): the throttle stick signed by
the gear switch, the gear on brake a stop, the steering stick a fraction of full lock.
The steering becomes a turn rate by the bicycle model, as ego expects; so the car can't
steer while it stands still (ego holds the wheels below 0.05 m/s), unlike RC direct.
