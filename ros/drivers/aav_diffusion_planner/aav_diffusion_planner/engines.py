"""
Which engine runs the model, and how much time each part of a plan may take. No ROS.

ONNX Runtime runs the one .onnx file on whichever engine ("execution provider") the
computer has. engines() turns the provider the node was given into ONNX Runtime's list,
best first, each with its settings, and always the CPU last: an engine that can't load
the model (no GPU, no TensorRT) hands it down the list instead of failing the plan.

  TensorrtExecutionProvider  the Orin (JetPack's TensorRT): FP16, the engine built once
                             and kept in a cache folder (the first start takes minutes)
  CUDAExecutionProvider      the Orin's GPU without TensorRT, or a desktop's NVIDIA card
  CoreMLExecutionProvider    a Mac's GPU and Neural Engine
  CPUExecutionProvider       anywhere: the fallback

BUDGET is the design's time budget for one plan (docs/designs/2026-11-02_diffusion-
planner.md, "Speed"); the node's hard stop is STOP_MS, after which the lattice's path goes.
