"""
The car with its lags, for the lag-aware MPC (mpc_lag): one small interface, no ROS.

The shared car model (aav_description car_model.py, with its Rust twin) is the truth: its
numbers (ActuatorConfig), its speed loops (SpeedLoopConfig), and mpc_lag's estimate
(car_model.step). This is the same maths 1-5 again, in the path's frame and on numpy
arrays (one column a state), because mpc_lag linearises it by finite differences 13 times
a stage, 30 stages a tick: car_model.step, one state at a time, would take most of the
tick. test_lag_model.py checks the two give the same states, step for step:

| Part | Model (one step dt) |
|---|---|
| speed loop | the spine's PI (spine-core speed_loop.rs; aav_gazebo SpeedLoop) |
| throttle, brake | first-order lags, exact: x += (command - x)(1 - exp(-dt / lag)) |
| speed | a = max_accel throttle (past its deadband) - max_brake brake - drag v |
| | the brake and drag never reverse v |
| steering motor | to its setpoint at most steer_rate dt a step; past steer_deadband only |
| wheels | lag the motor by steer_lag, + steer_offset, within full lock |
| the car | the kinematic bicycle about base_link, in the path's frame (Frenet); the new |
| | speed and steering, the heading at mid-step |
| dead times | floor(t / period + 0.5) ticks of the commands already sent (in mpc_lag) |

The numbers are vehicle.yaml's `actuators:` section, full lock and the wheelbase
(`CarParams.from_vehicle`). `step()` works on numpy arrays of states (one column each), so
mpc_lag linearises it by finite differences in one call a stage.

State (rows of x):
    E_Y, E_TH, S       cross track (+ left), heading error, distance along the path
    V                  speed, m/s (forward only)
    THROTTLE, BRAKE    the actuators' real levels, 0..1
    SETPOINT, MOTOR    the steering motor's target and angle, rad
    WHEELS             the wheels' angle after the linkage, before the offset, rad
    INTEGRAL           the speed loop's integral, throttle
Input (rows of u): STEER (the steering target, rad) and SPEED (the set speed, m/s).
