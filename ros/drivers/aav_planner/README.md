# aav_planner

Our own path planner, in Rust: Nav2's Smac **State Lattice** planner ported, run
**beside** Nav2's `planner_server` as a trial (`planner:=own`). Nav2 stays the default,
and on the car. The page: [docs/own-planner.md](../../../docs/own-planner.md).

```
global costmap (Nav2's /global_costmap/costmap_raw, or ours with costmap:=own), /tf
  -> planner -> /plan, /drivers/nav/planner/status
bt_navigator's compute_path_to_pose -> /drivers/nav/planner/compute_path_to_pose (ours)
planner_server keeps the lattice beside it: /compute_path_to_pose, /drivers/nav/planner/nav2_plan
```

## Overview

| Part | What it is |
|---|---|
| `crates/lattice-planner` | the maths, no ROS: the primitives file, the A* search, the Reeds-Shepp and Dubins curves, the car's outline check, the two estimates (heuristics), the smoother; `scenes.rs`: the hand-made maps |
| `crates/planner-node` | the ROS node, binary `planner` (rclrs): messages in and out only, one thread a plan |

```sh
pixi run sim planner:=own
pixi run measure controllers --planners lattice own --reversing --tours lot
```

## Interface

**`planner`** (`crates/planner-node/src/main.rs`), started by `aav_navigation`'s
`navigation.launch.py planner:=own`

| Item | What |
|---|---|
| Action | `/drivers/nav/planner/compute_path_to_pose` (nav2_msgs/action/ComputePathToPose); `bt_navigator`'s is remapped here |
| Subscribes | the global costmap (`costmap_topic`: Nav2's `/global_costmap/costmap_raw`, latched, with `_raw_updates`; or ours, `/drivers/nav/costmap/global_raw`); `/tf` (map -> odom -> base_link) |
| Publishes | `/plan` (nav_msgs/Path); `/drivers/nav/planner/status` (DiagnosticStatus, one a plan) |
| Parameters | `settings`: one JSON block from `aav_description`'s `vehicle.planner_params` (nav2.yaml's Lattice block as tuned, the car's outline, the global inflation); `costmap_topic`, `costmap_updates_topic`, `costmap_latched`, the frames |

## Invariants

- The same input as Nav2's lattice: the same primitives file, block and costmap.
- Nav2's error codes; Nav2's message types.
- No ROS in `crates/lattice-planner`; no maths in the node.
- `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` clean.

## Side Effects

- Serves the action, publishes the topics above. Nothing else.

## Verification

```sh
cargo test -p lattice-planner                                # curves, hand-made maps
cargo run --release -p lattice-planner --example scenes      # the maps, timed
pixi run build && colcon test --packages-select aav_planner
```
