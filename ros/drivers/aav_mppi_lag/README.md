# aav_mppi_lag

Nav2's MPPI path follower, ported to Rust, with the **actuators' lag in its model**.
A trial beside Nav2's own MPPI (`docs/trials.md`, `docs/mppi-lag.md`). Nav2 still plans
the path; this node follows it.

```
bt_navigator --FollowPath--> mppi_lag --cmd_vel_nav--> velocity_smoother
   -> collision_monitor -> /drivers/nav/cmd_vel (twist_mux 20) -> ego
controller_server keeps running; its own action is renamed follow_path_unused
```

## Overview

| Part | What it is |
|---|---|
| `crates/mppi-lag` | the maths, no ROS: the car model, MPPI, Nav2's critics, the checks |
| `crates/mppi-node` | the ROS node, binary `mppi_lag` (rclrs): messages in and out only |
| `config/mppi_lag.yaml` | its own settings: the model, the steering noise, its correlation |

What it adds to Nav2's MPPI:

| | Nav2's MPPI | `mppi_lag` |
|---|---|---|
| Model of the car | speed and turn rate obey at once (within ax, az limits) | ego's ramps, the spine's speed loop, throttle and brake lag, steering motor rate, linkage lag, deadbands, dead times |
| State it starts from | pose and speed | pose, speed, ego's output, the actuators' levels, the commands still in their dead time |
| Noise | white, on (v, w) | on (v, steering), correlated step to step (AR(1), 0.8) |
| Language | C++ plugin | Rust |

```sh
pixi run sim world:=test_lot reversing:=false tracker:=mppi_lag
pixi run measure controllers --trackers mppi_lag --controllers mppi --tours lot
```

## Interface

**`mppi_lag`** (`crates/mppi-node/src/main.rs`), started by `aav_navigation`'s
`navigation.launch.py tracker:=mppi_lag`

| Item | What |
|---|---|
| Action server | `/follow_path` (`nav2_msgs/action/FollowPath`): the newest path replaces the last without a stop |
| Subscribes | `/localization/odom/local` (Odometry); `/tf` (map -> odom, once per path); `/vehicle/steering`, `/vehicle/throttle`, `/vehicle/brake` (ActuatorState, measured, while fresh); `/local_costmap/costmap_raw` (nav2_msgs/Costmap) |
| Publishes | `/cmd_vel_nav` (TwistStamped); `/drivers/nav/track/status` (DiagnosticStatus, aav_track's keys and more); `/drivers/nav/local_plan` (Path, odom: MPPI's chosen future, the screens' faint line); `/drivers/nav/lag_aware` (Bool, latched) |

Results: succeeded; aborted with `FAILED_TO_MAKE_PROGRESS`, `NO_VALID_CONTROL`,
`INVALID_PATH`, `TF_ERROR`, `UNKNOWN` (no odometry); canceled.

### `lag_aware`

Ego's contract (0.3): `std_msgs/Bool` on `/drivers/<slot>/lag_aware`, reliable, transient
local, depth 1. This node drives through Nav2's slot, so `/drivers/nav/lag_aware`:

| When | Says |
|---|---|
| start, exit | `false` |
| a path starts, `model: lag` | `true` |
| the path ends (succeeded, aborted, cancelled) | `false` |
| `model: ideal` | always `false` |

Ego's lead turns off while it is `true`, so the lag isn't cancelled twice. Every
`TwistStamped` is stamped with now.

### Parameters

From `navigation.launch.py` (`vehicle.mppi_lag_params`; nothing copied):

| Name | From |
|---|---|
| `time_steps`, `model_dt`, `batch_size`, `iteration_count`, `temperature`, `gamma`, `vx_std`, `vx_max`, `critics`, `<Critic>.*` | nav2.yaml's `MPPI` block (`vx_max`: `max_speed:=` if given) |
| `prune_distance` | MPPI's, stretched to fit 2.8 s at `vx_max` (as `nav2_tuned`) |
| `rate_hz`, `odom_topic`, goal and progress checks | controller_server's |
| `footprint`, `footprint_padding`, `inflation_radius`, `cost_scaling_factor` | vehicle.yaml's body; the local costmap's |
| `wheelbase`, `max_steering_angle`, `actuators.*` | vehicle.yaml (dead times 0 while unset) |
| `ego.*` | ego.yaml's ramps |

From `config/mppi_lag.yaml`: `model` (lag or ideal), `steer_std`, `noise_correlation`,
`threads`, `seed`, `use_costmap`, the topics and timeouts. All read once at start.

### Crate `mppi-lag`

| Module | Holds |
|---|---|
| `model.rs` | `CarModel`: the trait any car model plugs in through (the shared car model at merge) |
| `lag.rs` | `LagModel`: the 0.3 spec |
| `shared.rs` (feature `shared`) | `SharedModel`: the shared `car-model` crate behind `CarModel`, with spine-core's own speed loop (any profile) |
| `ego.rs` | `Driven`: ego's ramps in front of any model |
| `ideal.rs` | `IdealModel`: no lag, as Nav2's MPPI |
| `optimizer.rs` | MPPI: sample, roll out (threads), score, softmax, Savitzky-Golay, shift |
| `critics.rs` | Nav2's eight critics in nav2.yaml |
| `path.rs`, `costmap.rs`, `smoothing.rs`, `rng.rs` | the path window, the costmap and outline, the filter, random numbers |
| `follower.rs` | one path: Nav2's goal and progress checks, the state estimate, MPPI |

## Invariants

- Forward only: `navigation.launch.py` refuses a tracker with `reversing:=true`.
- Never both followers: with it, controller_server's action is `follow_path_unused`.
- Nothing in the safety path changes: the smoother, collision_monitor, twist_mux's slot,
  the locks and e-stops all sit after `cmd_vel_nav`.
- The maths has no ROS; the node has no maths.
- `model_dt` must equal `1 / rate_hz` (the plan shifts one step a tick, as Nav2's).
- Rust API Guidelines; `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` clean; no dependencies in the crate
  by default. The feature `shared` adds the shared `car-model` crate (ours) as
  `SharedModel` behind `CarModel` (`shared.rs`: it drives as `LagModel` does, to 1 cm);
  the node still runs `LagModel`.

## Side Effects

- Publishes `/cmd_vel_nav` and its status only while a path runs. No files, no hardware.
- Uses one thread per core for the rollouts (`threads`).

## Verification

```sh
cd ros/drivers/aav_mppi_lag && cargo test --release -p mppi-lag          # tools/test.sh runs it
cargo test --release -p mppi-lag --test closed_loop explore -- --ignored --nocapture
cargo run --release -p mppi-lag --example timing                         # ms a tick
```

| Test | Covers |
|---|---|
| `lag.rs`, `ego.rs`, `ideal.rs` | each stage of the model: lags, rate, deadbands, dead times, offset, never reversing |
| `critics.rs` | each critic on hand-made samples |
| `optimizer.rs`, `smoothing.rs` | the limits, the filter, a straight path, a turn, the same seed the same plan |
| `tests/closed_loop.rs` | a pretend car (ego + the lag model at 100 Hz): the model predicts it; circle and S-curve at vehicle.yaml's lags; a corner and an S on very slow actuators, where only the lag-aware one keeps the path |

`colcon test --packages-select aav_mppi_lag` runs the same; `pixi run test` everything.
