//! The car model MPPI rolls its samples through: the [`CarModel`] trait.
//!
//! The trait is the seam for the shared car-model crate (another 0.3 job). Until it
//! merges, [`crate::LagModel`] implements the agreed spec here, and [`crate::IdealModel`]
//! is the lag-free model Nav2's MPPI uses, for comparison. At the merge, the shared
//! crate's model implements this trait (or this trait becomes theirs) and nothing else
//! changes.
