The behaviour states: why the car should slow, and the speed cap that slows it.

No ROS here (behaviour_node.py is the node). docs/stopping.md, part 2; the design:
docs/designs/2026-11-05_behaviour-and-speed.md.

```text
 DRIVE ─► APPROACH ─► STOPPED ─► WAIT ─► GO ─► DRIVE
  (no cap)  (cap falls)  (lock on,  (lock on)  (cap rises)
                         still)        │
                                       └─► ASK (a person is told)
```

The cap slows the car. **It can't stop it**: a lock or Nav2's goal check makes the final
stop. So a cap is 0.0 (Nav2: no limit) or at least the floor, never in between
(stop_law.nav2_cap), and this module never clears a lock, a latch or the e-stop.

Each stop is a `Stop`: a reason, the metres `left` before its final stop, and the lock
that makes that stop (none for the goal: Nav2's goal check does). The cap for a stop is
the stopping law's v_cap(left) (aav_description stop_law.py). The lowest one binds.

| Reason | `left` is | The final stop |
|---|---|---|
| `sign` | camera range to the sign − the watcher's `stop_distance_m` | the `stop_sign` lock |
| `obstacle` | to a thing in the lane, less bumper and stop zone | the `stop_zone` lock |
| `fence` | along the plan to where the geofence would close NEAR | the `geofence` lock |
| `goal` | along the plan to its end | Nav2's goal check |
