//! spine_bridge's logic, with no ROS: what the Orin sends the spine over CAN, and what it
//! makes of the frames it hears.
//!
//! The frames are `firmware/can/aav.dbc`, packed by the firmware's own code
//! (`spine-core`'s `protocol`), so the bridge and the spine share one implementation.
//! The ROS node (`bridge-node`) only turns messages into calls here and [`Update`]s back
//! into messages. A port of aav_spine's `spine_bridge.py` and `wheel_speed.py`; its tests
//! carry their cases.
//!
//! - [`Bridge::drive`]: DRIVE_CMD at 50 Hz while ego's command is fresh, with the arming
//!   edge (armed=0 frames before armed=1);
//! - [`Bridge::arm`]: refused during an e-stop, and while the safety gate is shut
//!   ([`OutputGate`]: the output mux not OPEN for this bridge's [`Target`], or quiet);
//! - [`Bridge::set_estop`], [`Bridge::estop_frame`]: ESTOP_CMD, at once on a change and
//!   as a 10 Hz heartbeat;
//! - [`Bridge::receive`]: VEHICLE_FEEDBACK, VEHICLE_STATUS and the front wheel nodes'
//!   WHEEL_SPEED_L and WHEEL_SPEED_R, into [`Update`]s;
//! - [`Role`]: `Spine` does all of that. `Sensors` only listens to the wheel nodes and
//!   never sends, for a car driven another way (today's: the ESP32, through the Motor
//!   Pi's UART; docs/can-plan.md).
