//! Our own simulator's core: Gazebo's job, in Rust, with no ROS and no Bevy.
//!
//! | Module | Holds |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`world`] | the worlds Gazebo reads (`*.sdf`, `model://`, OBJ meshes), as triangles |
//! | [`scene`] | what a ray can hit: a bounding volume tree, and objects placed while running |
//! | [`car`] | the car: the [`car::CarModel`] trait, Gazebo's twist follower, the actuator model |
//! | `shared_car` (feature `shared`) | `SharedCar`: the shared car-model crate behind the [`car::CarModel`] trait |
//! | [`lidar`] | the roof lidar and the radar stand-in, by ray casting, packed as Gazebo's |
//! | [`geo`] | the datum, and world positions as latitude and longitude |
//! | [`sim`] | the loop: step the car, and which stream speaks when; the camera plug-in |
//! | [`noise`] | seeded noise, so the same seed gives the same sensor streams |
//! | [`math`] | vectors, rotations, poses |
//!
//! Units: m, m/s, rad, s. Frames: REP-103 and REP-105, the world = the map (x east, y
//! north), `base_link` on the ground under the rear axle.
