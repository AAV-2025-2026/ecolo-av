Each wheel's ground speed from Gazebo's joint states, for /vehicle/wheels. No ROS here.

Also the steering angle Gazebo's front wheels really have (centre_steering), for
tools/gazebo_steering.py: Gazebo's wheels against the actuator model's angle.

The wheel joints turn about their +y axis (aav.urdf.xacro): positive spin rolls the car
forward, so speed = spin (rad/s) x the wheel's radius.
