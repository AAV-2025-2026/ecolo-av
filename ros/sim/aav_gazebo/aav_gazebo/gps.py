"""
What the car's GPS receiver says about its velocity, from Gazebo's truth. No ROS here.

A u-blox receiver reports the antenna's velocity, east, north and up (ublox_gps's
fix_velocity), from the satellites' Doppler shift: good to about 0.05 m/s. Gazebo's NavSat
sensor has a velocity too, but ros_gz_bridge's NavSatFix leaves it out, so gazebo_gps
works it out from the car's true motion instead, with the receiver's noise on top.
