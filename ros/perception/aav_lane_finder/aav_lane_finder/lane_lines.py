"""
Lane lines in the bird's-eye view: find the paint, follow each line, say where the car is.

No ROS imports, so the tests run anywhere. For each camera picture:

1. `paint_mask`: paint is brighter than the road on both sides of it, and narrow.
2. `follow`: sliding windows climb each line from where it starts near the car.
3. `fit_line`: a second-order fit through the paint they found, y = a x^2 + b x + c, in
   base_link (metres), and how sure the finder is of it (0 to 1).
4. `lane_from`: the car's offset from the lane's centre, the lane's width, each line's
   radius and the way the road bends: aav_lane_geometry/LaneGeometry's fields.

Signs follow REP-103: x forward, y left. The offset is + when the car is left of the lane's
centre: control_interface then steers right, back to the centre. It is measured `lookahead`
metres ahead of base_link, because a PID on the offset at the rear axle weaves; a few
metres ahead, the offset also says which way the car is pointing.
