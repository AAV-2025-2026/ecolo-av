"""
Pictures of a flat road, for the lane finder's tests, drawn from first principles.

Each pixel's ray is followed down to the ground, and the ground point is coloured by where
it lies in the lane. None of this comes from the finder's own code, so a mistake in its
geometry can't hide behind the same mistake in the picture.
