#   timing       are messages on time? Gazebo parked, then driving (about 10 min; docs/mac.md)
#   stream       the camera stream end to end, without the car (pixi run get mediamtx first;
#                docs/camera-pipeline.md)
#   atob         score A-to-B runs from bags or CSVs (docs/a-to-b.md)
#   lane         a long lane drive, scored by the truth: lateral error, lane lost, speed
#                (Gazebo or ours; the road world or the campus; docs/perception.md)
#   bandwidth    every topic of a running system: Hz, size, MB/s (docs/bandwidth.md)
#
# All but bandwidth start or read a simulator on this computer only (tools/ros.sh
# --local), so they never reach a real car. bandwidth measures whatever runs on this ROS
# domain: the car too.
# Each script's own --help lists its options.
