ekf_global refuses a GPS jump, but never the car's first fix (docs/simulation.md, 15 Oct).

robot_localization refuses a measurement whose squared Mahalanobis distance is at or over
threshold^2 (filter_base.cpp, checkMahalanobisThreshold): for a position, roughly its
distance over sqrt(the filter's variance + the fix's).
