Judge whether a stream is a drop-in.

Ben, 5 Nov: "just swap out and test". No ROS here; tools/drop_in_check.py measures and
tools/tests/test_drop_in.py tests this.

A topic's `drop_in:` in docs/interfaces.yaml holds what its stream must be, beyond the name
and type: `min_hz`, `max_hz`, `frame` and `reliable`. Gazebo, our simulator and the real
sensor must all pass it. Passing is necessary, not enough: it says nothing of a stream's values.
