# Our own navigator

Ben, 8 Nov: move off Nav2 **one piece at a time**, each beside Nav2 until it wins. The
order: the costmap ([done](own-costmap.md)), the planner ([done](own-planner.md)), then
**the navigator** (this page), the last piece. Nav2 stays the default, and on the car.

> **The short version**
> - **Switch:** `navigator:=own`. Package `aav_navigator` (Rust).
> - **What it is:** what Nav2's `bt_navigator`, our behaviour trees and
>   `waypoint_follower` do for the car, as one state machine.
> - **Drop-in:** Nav2's four actions, under `/drivers/nav/navigator/`. Each goal sender
>   has a `navigator` switch.
> - **All ours:** `navigator:=own planner:=own costmap:=own tracker:=mppi_lag`. Then no
>   Nav2 server navigates.
> - **Scores:** test lot 7 of 12 legs (Nav2 8); the box 3 of 3 (Nav2 3); campus 4 of 6
>   (Nav2 2); P4 to the Fieldhouse 1 of 2 (Nav2 0). Not the default yet.

## How it fits

```
goal senders ──▶ navigator (ours) ──ComputePathToPose──────────▶ planner (ours or Nav2's)
 RViz, map,          │            ──ComputePathThroughPoses────▶
 street_router,      │            ──FollowPath─────────────────▶ mppi_lag (or controller_server)
 language_drive,     │            ──ClearEntireCostmap─────────▶ costmaps (ours or Nav2's)
 the tools           └──────────── /drivers/nav/navigator/status
                                   mppi_lag ─▶ velocity smoother ─▶ collision_monitor ─▶ twist_mux
```

The safety locks, collision_monitor and twist_mux never change.

| Action (ours) | Nav2's | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `/drivers/nav/navigator/navigate_to_pose` | `/navigate_to_pose` | the tools, sim-check, RViz (`/goal_pose`) |
| `/drivers/nav/navigator/navigate_through_poses` | `/navigate_through_poses` | anyone with several poses |
| `/drivers/nav/navigator/follow_waypoints` | `/follow_waypoints` | map waypoints |
| `/drivers/nav/navigator/follow_gps_waypoints` | `/follow_gps_waypoints` | street_router, language_drive |

**Who sends to which.** `vehicle.navigator_action(navigator, name)` gives the name.
`street_router` and `language_drive` have a `navigator` parameter;
`measure controllers --stacks` and `sim-check --navigator` choose by the switch.

## What it does

```
goal ─▶ plan ─▶ follow ─▶ plan again every second
          │        │        (near the goal: keep the path, TODO 17)
          ▼        ▼
   clear global  clear local      ◀── a failure a recovery can fix
          └────────┴─▶ in turn: clear both ─▶ wait 5 s ─▶ back up 1 m (reversing only)
                       up to 6 times, then give up with Nav2's error code
```

| Step | Ours | Nav2's trees |
|---|---|---|
| plan | every 1 s (through-poses 3 s) | the same |
| the final approach | keep the path within 8 m of the goal, under 20 s old | the same |
| a failed replan, while driving a good path | keep driving; give up after 4 in a row | stops the car at once |
| through-poses | drop a pose within 1 m, **or once passed along the path** | within 1 m only |
| waypoints, GPS waypoints | **one through-poses goal**: no stop at each | stop and face each one |
| recoveries | clear, wait, back up, in turn, 6 at most | the same |
| lat/lon to the map | navsat_transform's datum (the same UTM steps) | calls `/fromLL` |
| a new goal | replaces the running one, on any action | refused on the other navigator |

Each change is in `ros/drivers/aav_navigator/PROVENANCE.md`.

**What all ours leaves running from Nav2:** `map_server` (the map), the velocity
smoother, and collision_monitor (the command line in front of the safety locks).

## Try it

| To | Run |
|---|---|
| See it | `pixi run sim navigator:=own planner:=own costmap:=own tracker:=mppi_lag reversing:=false` |
| Score all ours against all Nav2 | `pixi run measure controllers --stacks nav2 own --tours lot obstacle --runs 3` |
| The campus route | `pixi run measure controllers --stacks nav2 own --tours fieldhouse --speed 2.5` |
| The graph and a goal | `pixi run sim-check --navigator own --planner own --costmap own --tracker mppi_lag` |
| Test the maths | `cd ros/drivers/aav_navigator && cargo test -p navigator` |

## Scores (8 Nov, our simulator)

All ours (`navigator:=own planner:=own costmap:=own tracker:=mppi_lag`) against all Nav2
(`bt_navigator`, the lattice, Nav2's costmaps, MPPI). Both forward only: `mppi_lag`
can't reverse. `pixi run measure controllers --stacks nav2 own`.

### The test lot, 1 m/s, 3 runs

| Leg | All Nav2 | All ours |
|---|---|---|
| a left turn | 3 / 3 (26-55 s) | 3 / 3 (24 s) |
| round the building | 3 / 3 (46-47 s) | 2 / 3 (44-45 s) |
| turn back (a U-turn in a 14 m lane) | **0 / 3** | **1 / 3** |
| home | 2 / 3 (87-88 s) | 1 / 3 (85 s) |
| **legs reached** | **8 / 12** | **7 / 12** |
| off the path, mean | 0.12 m | 0.17 m |
| sway | 0.038 m/s² | 0.050 m/s² |
| the follower's CPU | 17-18 % | 33-39 % |

- **Forward only, the U-turn is the hard leg for both.** A car that ends it against a
  wall can't start the next leg ("start occupied"): Nav2 lost "home" that way once, ours
  twice (once already on "round the building").

### The box in the lane, 3 runs

| | All Nav2 | All ours |
|---|---|---|
| past the box | 3 / 3, 36-37 s | 3 / 3, 34 s |

### sim-check, all ours

`pixi run sim-check --navigator own --planner own --costmap own --tracker mppi_lag
--obstacle --plan-around`: **all 13 checks pass** (the graph against the contract, the
Nav2 goal past the box after the stop zone, the drive round the box).

### The campus, 2.5 m/s, 2 runs

| Leg | All Nav2 | All ours |
|---|---|---|
| out of the lot (47 m) | **2 / 2** (28-29 s) | **0 / 2**: past the goal, then round a block (251-266 m) |
| along the road (254 m) | 0 / 2: "Start occupied" | 2 / 2 (223-250 s) |
| round the bend (246 m) | 0 / 2: "Start occupied" | 2 / 2 (135-137 s) |
| **P4 to the Fieldhouse** (453 m, 18 GPS waypoints) | **0 / 2**: stuck at the lot exit after 45 m, 16 waypoints missed | **1 / 2** (263 s, 590 m driven); once stuck at the same exit |

- **Out of the lot:** `mppi_lag` misses the goal at 2.5 m/s. It does the same under
  Nav2's navigator (274 m, one run): the follower, not the navigator.
- **Ours gets past "Start occupied"** by clearing the global costmap and planning again.

### Why "along the road" failed (TODO 144's MPPI give-up)

| What | Seen |
|---|---|
| Where | the end of "out of the lot", **inside the lot's exit** (about 73, -38) |
| The static map there | clear: nothing within 2.4 m of the car |
| The global costmap there | **lidar marks** within 1.5 m of the car: only at the two lot exits (59, -44 and 72, -38), in 7 of 6,199 samples |
| Nav2's planner | "Start occupied" |
| Nav2's MPPI (with reversing) | "Optimizer fail": every future starts in collision |

The car stops on its goal in a narrow exit, with the kerbs the lidar marked touching its
padded outline. Every future and every plan starts "in collision", and Nav2 gives up at
once (it doesn't count "start occupied" as fixable). Ours clears the costmap and plans
again. A goal a few metres past the exit would avoid it.

### The verdict

- **Not the sim default yet.** On the lot it is as good as Nav2 (7 against 8 of 12,
  inside the noise of the U-turn), on the box the same, on the campus better (4 against 2
  of 6; the route 1 against 0 of 2).
- **But:** `mppi_lag` overshoots the campus's first goal at 2.5 m/s, and uses twice
  Nav2's MPPI's CPU. Fix the follower's goal approach first, then run again.

## What's missing

- **The goal at speed:** `mppi_lag` passes the campus's first goal at 2.5 m/s.
- **Reversing:** all ours is forward only (`mppi_lag`), so a car against a wall stays.

- **On the car:** untested; `car.launch.py` always passes `navigator:=nav2`.
- **No `IsPathValid`** on the final approach: the navigator reads no costmap.
- **Back up** still calls Nav2's `behavior_server` (reversing only; `mppi_lag` can't reverse).
