# How the car stops

One stopping law for every planned stop, a behaviour planner that uses it to slow Nav2,
and a check of where the car really stops. Ben, 7 Nov: "we can use that to say if we have
turned enough or slowing down enough". The designs:
[how the car stops](designs/2026-11-05_how-the-car-stops.md),
[behaviour and speed](designs/2026-11-05_behaviour-and-speed.md).

> **Every number is a GUESS** until car tests 4.1-4.5 ([actuator tests](actuator-tests.md)).
> The locks don't use any of this: they keep their own laws.

## 1. The stopping law

```text
   S(v)  =  v·τ  +  v²/(2a)           τ = ρ + a/(2j)
            └┬─┘    └──┬──┘
       delay + easing  braking

   the cap:     v_cap(d) = a·( √(τ² + 2d/a) − τ )     the speed that stops in d metres
```

`aav_description` `stop_law.py` (no ROS): `StopCurve(a, j, rho)` with `distance(v)`,
`cap(d)`, `demand(v)`, `h(room, v, margin)`.

### Its numbers come from the car model

| Symbol | Means | From | Today |
|---|---|---|---|
| `a` | planned braking | half the softer of ego's `max_deceleration` and `max_brake` | 1.0 m/s² |
| `j` | jerk | ego's `max_jerk` | 2.0 m/s³ |
| `ρ` | every delay | input age 0.15 s + brake dead time + `brake_lag` + **the speed loop's lag** | 1.22 s |
| `τ` | delay + easing | ρ + a/(2j) | 1.47 s |

**The speed loop's lag** (new, not in the design): the spine's default PI coasts until the
car is 0.2 m/s too fast, then brakes 0.5 per m/s past that. To brake at 1 m/s² it must be
0.87 m/s too fast: 0.87 s behind. Without it, the law overran the point by 0.3-0.4 m on
the pretend car. `loop=None` gives the design's ρ 0.35.

| Distance left | 0.5 m | 1 m | 2 m | 5 m | 10 m |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `v_cap` | 0.31 m/s | 0.57 m/s | 1.01 m/s | 2.02 m/s | 3.24 m/s |

### Who uses it

| User | Before | Now | Check |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trial trackers (`aav_track` `speed.py`) | `√(2·1.5·d)` | **the law** | never a higher speed, at every distance (`test_speed.py`) |
| Point driver (`aav_drive_to_point`) | `√(2a(d − 0.8v))` | the same; **`stop_law:=hybrid`** picks the law (a trial) | stops at B on the pretend car (`test_drive.py`) |
| ego's start-up log | `0.4v + v²/2a` | both lines: the hardest stop, and the planned one | the plan is never shorter (`test_dynamics.py`) |
| Behaviour planner | none | the law | below |
| The geofence's lock | RSS | **unchanged** (Simplex) | its worst case is never shorter than where the car model stops (`test_geofence.py`). Above about 0.7 m/s the law plans **more** room than the lock (1.97 against 1.40 m at 1 m/s on the spine), so the car slows before the lock closes |
| The stop sign's lock | 4.7 m | **unchanged** | |

### Point driver, pretend car (ego and Gazebo's actuator model)

| From | Law | Stop error | Peak braking | Time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 m/s, 10 m | approach | +0.06 m | 0.77 m/s² | 15.4 s |
| 1 m/s, 10 m | hybrid | +0.09 m | 0.77 m/s² | 15.3 s |
| 3 m/s, 30 m | approach | +0.04 m | 1.32 m/s² | 19.7 s |
| 3 m/s, 30 m | hybrid | +0.09 m | **0.78 m/s²** | 19.9 s |

Gentler at speed, 5 cm further past B. Not yet run in Gazebo.

## 2. The behaviour planner

`aav_behaviour` (a trial, **off by default**): `pixi run sim world:=road behaviour:=true`.
It knows why the car should slow, and sends Nav2 a speed cap. **It can't stop the car**:
a lock or Nav2's goal check makes every final stop.

```text
 DRIVE ─► APPROACH ─► STOPPED ─► WAIT ─► GO ─► DRIVE
  (no cap)  (cap falls)  (lock on,  (lock on)  (cap rises)
                         still)        │
                                       └─► ASK (a person is told)
```

| Stop for | `left` | The final stop |
|---|---|---|
| A stop sign | camera range to the sign − 4.7 m | the `stop_sign` lock |
| An obstacle in the lane | lidar: nearest point ahead − bumper − stop zone | collision_monitor, then the `stop_zone` lock |
| The fence | along the plan to where the geofence would say NEAR | the geofence's lock |
| The goal | along the plan to its end | Nav2's goal check |

### The cap

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| `v_cap(left)` of the lowest stop | the stopping law, above |
| 0.0, or between 0.3 m/s and Nav2's top speed | Nav2 reads 0.0 as **no limit** |
| Falls no faster than 2 m/s² | MPPI cuts its turn rate at once, its speed later |
| The sign's cap never rises in APPROACH | a new picture can't speed the car up |
| Rises at 0.5 m/s² in GO | |
| Odometry stale: the floor | |

### Topics

| Topic | Type | |
|---|---|---|
| `/drivers/nav/speed_limit` | `nav2_msgs/SpeedLimit`, 20 Hz | controller_server reads it with `behaviour:=true` |
| `/drivers/nav/behaviour/state` | `diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticStatus`, 5 Hz | for the screens: state, reason, cap, left |
| `/perception/stop_sign/distance` | `geometry_msgs/PointStamped` | new, from the watcher: where the sign is |

### In Gazebo (8 Nov, `pixi run sim-check --behaviour`)

| Stop | Result |
|---|---|
| Obstacle | passed 2 of 4 runs: APPROACH, cap down to 0.3 m/s, the stop zone fired at 0.50 m/s, the bumper 0.8 m from the box |
| Obstacle, the other 2 | the car went round the box (the lidar is on, so MPPI may steer round it): no stop to score |
| Goal | APPROACH from 2 m out, lowest cap 0.48-0.68 m/s; reached, 0.9 m from the goal |
| Stop sign (`-e ml ... --perception`) | the lock stopped the car 3.5 m before the sign, but the behaviour **never entered APPROACH(sign)**: still to find out why |

At 1 m/s the law's cap binds only in the last 2 m, so the slowing is short.

### Not built yet

| Part | Why it waits |
|---|---|
| The `patient` progress checker | a stock tree edit; holds over 10 s still look stuck to Nav2 |
| ASK's reply (`/hud/ask/answer`) | the HUD has no reply path |
| The trial trackers reading the cap | they ignore `/drivers/nav/speed_limit` |
| The car | the stage gates in the design: `pi` mode first |

## 3. Where the car really stops

`pixi run sim-check --stop-point` (the empty world, the spine in the loop, about 4 minutes).

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| 1 | a scripted drive at 0.5, 0.75 and 1 m/s (the spine's top speed: 1 m/s) |
| 2 | steady for 1.5 s, then the e-stop: the spine brakes fully |
| 3 | the prediction: the first `/ego/stop_point` after the press (ego, the shared car model, full brake) |
| 4 | moved to the map by `/tf` at its stamp |
| 5 | scored against Gazebo's truth and the global EKF |

Pass: within 0.25 m, or 10 % of the distance if more. A drive that never reached half
its speed fails. The maths is `tools/stop_points.py`: it can score a bag from the car
later, with a tape measure for the truth.

### Numbers (8 Nov)

| From | Predicted | Truth | Localization | Stop point after the press |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.54 m/s | 0.11 m | 0.12 m | 0.37 m | 3 ms |
| 0.77 m/s | 0.19 m | 0.18 m | 0.17 m | 43 ms |
| 0.98 m/s | 0.30 m | 0.24 m | 0.33 m | 83 ms |

The stopping law plans far more (0.95, 1.42 and 1.93 m): it plans a gentle stop at
1 m/s², not a full brake.

## 4. A heavier car: the adaptive brake

Ben, 8 Nov: "if we brake without a person vs with a person ... we are going to need to
dynamically realize that we aren't braking as fast as we expect and start applying more
force. We don't want to overwhelm the brakes though."

The same brake stops a heavier car more slowly (a = F / m). With 150 kg aboard, the
181 kg car brakes at 55 % of its empty strength.

### Where it sits

```text
 ego ─▶ speed loop ─▶ brake asked ─▶ adaptive brake ─▶ brake sent ─▶ brake actuator
                                         ▲
                                   wheel speed

 e-stop, stale command, silent spine ─▶ full brake   (the locks: never through it)
```

Below ego and every safety lock: it only adds to what the speed loop asks.

### What it does, each tick

| Step | What |
|---|---|
| 1 | measures the slowing from the wheel speed |
| 2 | works out the slowing the **empty** car model expects for the brake sent |
| 3 | learns the **effectiveness**: measured ÷ expected (1 empty, 0.55 with 150 kg) |
| 4 | brakes harder by 1 ÷ effectiveness (at most 3 times) |
| 5 | the extra rises at most 2 (full brake) a second |
| 6 | **never above the safe max** |
| 7 | near the safe max for longer than **max hold time**: the extra comes off |

It keeps what it learnt from stop to stop: a person aboard stays aboard.

### The brake's limits (`vehicle.yaml`, `brake:`)

Like the steering's ends. **Placeholders** until car day A7, rows 6-8
([car day](car-day.md#a7-the-brake-on-stands)).

| Key | Placeholder | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `released` | 400 | the brake actuator's target with the brake let go |
| `touch` | 800 | where the pads start to grip |
| `full` | 3500 | full brake |
| `safe_max` | 3200 | the most the brake may ever be pushed |
| `max_hold_time` | 5 s | how long near `safe_max` |

`released` and `full` must match the firmware's (`calibration.rs`); a test checks.

### Try it

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `pixi run sim payload:=150` | a heavier car, the adaptive brake off |
| `pixi run sim payload:=150 adaptive_brake:=true` | the same, with it on |
| `ros2 param set /gazebo_adapter payload 90` | change the load while it runs |
| `pixi run sim-check --loaded-stop-only` | the check below |

Not with `spine:=true` or `esp32:=true`: there the firmware decides the brake.

### The check: `--loaded-stop`

A stop from 2 m/s at 1 m/s², four times. The prediction is always the **empty** car
model's. Pass: within 0.25 m.

### Numbers (8 Nov): the car model alone

`test_adaptive_brake.py`, from 2 m/s; the empty model says 3.35 m.

| Aboard | Adaptive brake | Stopped in | Off by | Most brake |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 kg | off | 3.35 m | 0.00 m | 0.30 |
| 150 kg | off | 3.93 m | **+0.58 m** | 0.42 |
| 0 kg | on | 3.35 m | 0.00 m | 0.30 |
| 150 kg | on | 3.40 m | +0.04 m | 0.59 |
| 150 kg | on, the next stop | 3.23 m | −0.12 m | 0.55 |

It learnt 0.55, the right share. The next stop brakes harder from the start, so it stops
a little short.

### In the simulator (8 Nov)

`pixi run sim-check --loaded-stop-only`, our simulator, the empty world. Each against
the empty car model fed the same commands.

| Aboard | Adaptive brake | From | Model | Truth | Off by | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 kg | off | 1.77 m/s | 3.00 m | 3.05 m | +0.04 m | ✅ |
| 150 kg | off | 2.05 m/s | 3.20 m | 4.08 m | **+0.87 m** | ✅ (must miss) |
| 0 kg | on | 1.77 m/s | 3.00 m | 3.05 m | +0.05 m | ✅ |
| 150 kg | on | 2.05 m/s | 3.22 m | 3.43 m | +0.21 m | ✅ |
| 150 kg | on, the next stop | 2.05 m/s | 3.22 m | 3.27 m | +0.05 m | ✅ |

The first loaded stop learns while it brakes; the next one starts knowing.
