# Trials: new path followers and localizers beside the main ones

Ben, 29 Oct: "We want to make other nodes or plugins that we can test and then replace
the main ones if they work." Each trial runs **beside** today's default, chosen at launch,
and is **scored on the same routes**. It becomes the default only once it wins.

> **The short version**
> - **Trackers** (`aav_track`): pure pursuit, Stanley, LQR, MPC, in Nav2's own chain, in controller_server's place. `tracker:=lqr`.
> - **AMCL** (stock `nav2_amcl`): a particle filter on the map and the lidar, scored against the EKF, never steering. `amcl:=true`.
> - **Score:** `pixi run controller-compare --trackers pure_pursuit lqr --runs 3`.
> - **Results:** not run yet.
> - The design: `docs/designs/2026-10-29_trials.md`.

## What is on trial

| Trial | Scored against | Switch |
|---|---|---|
| Stanley steering | our pure pursuit | `tracker:=stanley` |
| LQR steering, gains by speed | our pure pursuit | `tracker:=lqr` |
| MPC steering, within the steering's limits | our pure pursuit | `tracker:=mpc` |
| our pure pursuit (the control) | Nav2's RPP and MPPI | `tracker:=pure_pursuit` |
| AMCL | the global EKF | `amcl:=true` |

## Where a tracker sits

```
goal ─► bt_navigator ─► planner_server (Smac Hybrid-A*, replans every 1 s)
              │ FollowPath ("follow_path")
              ▼
   tracker:=none (default)          tracker:=stanley | lqr | mpc | pure_pursuit
   controller_server (MPPI, RPP)    aav_track's track node; controller_server's own
                                    action is renamed follow_path_unused
              └──────► cmd_vel_nav ◄──────┘
                            │
        velocity_smoother → collision_monitor → /drivers/nav/cmd_vel (twist_mux 20) → ego
```

Nothing after `cmd_vel_nav` changes: the same smoother, stop zone, mux slot, locks and
e-stops.

## Fair rules

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| One speed policy for every tracker: RPP's cruise speed, slower in bends, stop by distance | off-path error grows with speed |
| Nav2's own goal and progress checks (nav2.yaml: 1.0 m, 0.75 rad) | the same "done" for all |
| Track in `odom`; each path moved there once | the map pose jumps with GPS |
| Forward only (`reversing:=false`: a tracker is refused otherwise) | the trackers drive forwards only |
| 3 runs each, mean and spread (`--runs 3`) | MPPI is random; one run names no winner |
| Loop time and missed ticks recorded | a slow MPC mustn't look like bad maths |

## Run it

```bash
pixi run sim world:=test_lot reversing:=false tracker:=mpc      # watch one
pixi run sim world:=test_lot amcl:=true                         # AMCL beside the EKF
pixi run controller-compare --trackers pure_pursuit stanley lqr mpc --runs 3
pixi run controller-compare --amcl                              # score AMCL too
```

## Results

Not run yet. Each run's results go here, with its date and a link to its folder in
`log/controller-compare/`.

## Before a winner goes on the car

- Gazebo's map is perfect and its GPS noise simple: **AMCL feeds the EKF only after it
  also wins on a bag from the real lot.** On the car, slam_toolbox's map needs aligning
  to the GPS `map` frame first.
- AMCL publishes only after the car moves (`update_min_d`): parked, few samples.
- The trackers don't read the costmap: MPPI stays for the obstacle tours (design T3).
