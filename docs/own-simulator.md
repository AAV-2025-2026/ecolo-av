# Our own simulator

Ben, 7 Nov: "merge in everything from gazebo so its standalone in rust". This page is the
simulator's **core**: the world, the car, the lidar, the radar, the IMU, the GPS, the wheels
and the clock. The cameras are their own program ([its page](own-simulator-cameras.md)),
started beside it. The plan: [the design](designs/2026-11-05_own-simulator.md).

```sh
pixi run sim world:=test_lot gui:=false rviz:=false     # ours: the default since 8 Nov
pixi run sim-check                                     # the road world's checks, on ours
pixi run sim simulator:=gazebo world:=test_lot         # Gazebo, as before
```

**Ours is the default since 8 Nov**: it passed every `sim-check` leg Gazebo passes (below).
Gazebo stays, as `simulator:=gazebo`: to compare, and on a computer with no GPU (GitHub's
CI, oirp-spss), where our cameras can't draw (`sim_cameras` says "no GPU to draw with")
but Gazebo's can, in software (`tools/software_gl.sh`).

## In one picture

```text
 ego ─> output mux ─> gazebo_adapter ──/gazebo/cmd_vel──> simulator (Rust)
                      (actuator model)                      │ world: Gazebo's .sdf files
                                                            │ car, rays, IMU, GPS, clock
 gazebo_imu, gazebo_gps, gazebo_radar, gazebo_adapter <─────┘ Gazebo's topics, rates, QoS
   └─> /sensors/*, /vehicle/*  ─> localization, Nav2, safety: unchanged
```

It replaces `gz sim` **and** its bridges. Every node above them is the same one Gazebo uses.

## What it gives

| Topic | Rate | Same as Gazebo? |
|---|---|---|
| `/clock` | 1 kHz | yes: one per step |
| `/gazebo/odom`, `/vehicle/sim/truth` | 50 Hz | yes |
| `/gazebo/imu` | 50 Hz, noise 0.02 rad/s, 0.2 m/s² | yes (the xacro's) |
| `/gazebo/navsat` | 5 Hz, noise 4.5e-6° (0.5 m) | yes; exact WGS84 from the world's datum |
| `/joint_states` | 100 Hz | Gazebo sends 1 kHz; the car's wheels 100 Hz |
| `/sensors/lidar/points` | 10 Hz, 1800 x 16, 0.5-100 m, 3 cm | yes: packed as Gazebo's, organised, `inf` misses |
| `/gazebo/radar/points` | 10 Hz, 61 x 3, 0.3-8.4 m, 5 cm | yes |
| the three car cameras, the chase camera | 10 Hz, 640 x 360 | yes: `aav_sim_cameras` draws the same world file |

## The worlds

| World | Read | Triangles |
|---|---|---|
| `empty`, `road`, `test_lot` | `aav_gazebo/worlds/*.sdf`, with `model://stop_sign` | 2 to 118 |
| `campus` | `maps/campus/campus.sdf` and its OBJ meshes (`pixi run campus`) | 595,845, read in 1.2 s |

The rays see what Gazebo's lidar sees: the **visuals**. One roof-lidar scan takes 1.7 ms in the
test lot and 15 ms on the campus (Ben's Mac, 4 threads).

## The car

| Part | How |
|---|---|
| Today | `gazebo_adapter`'s actuator model, then Gazebo's AckermannSteering (±10 m/s², the wheels steer at once), then the bicycle |
| Hitting things | the outline (`vehicle.yaml` `body:`) stops at what it meets, at 0.35, 0.8 and 1.3 m up, as Gazebo's physics does. The log says "the car hit something" |
| The ground (8 Nov) | each wheel finds the ground below it (a ray straight down). The car rides up a slope and tilts on it; a step up to 0.1 m (`ground_step`) it rolls up; a higher one (a 0.3 m kerb) stops it, as a wall does. The truth carries the height and tilt, so the cameras follow |
| The trait | `sim-core` `CarModel`: `step`, `state`, `reset`, `hold`. The shared `car-model` crate goes in behind it at the merge |
| `ActuatorCar` | the actuator model itself, to `car-model`'s rules (exact lags, rate-limited motor, deadband, dead time). Tested; not wired in yet |

## Plug-in points

| For | Where | What it gets |
|---|---|---|
| Cameras, as their own program | `/vehicle/sim/truth` | the car's pose, 50 Hz, on sim time |
| Cameras, in the loop | `sim-core` `SensorPlugin` | the world, the car, `base_link`, the time, at its own period |
| The cameras' world | `World::shapes` | every shape as SDF draws it: box, cylinder, plane, mesh file; pose; colour |
| Placing things | `/vehicle/sim/spawn_entity`, `delete_entity` | `simulation_interfaces`: an SDF model, a pose |

With `simulator:=own`, `gazebo.launch.py` starts the cameras (`sim_cameras --ros --pose truth
--world <the world>`) and sets `gazebo_adapter`'s `cameras` to true, so `/system/source`
announces them, as with Gazebo.

## Head to head, with the cameras (8 Nov, Ben's Mac, quiet: load 4-15)

The same `sim-check` legs on both, one run after the other, nothing else running.

| Check | Ours | Gazebo |
|---|---|---|
| `sim-check` (start-up, contract, sensors, all 3 cameras, lidar, scan, scripted drive, EKF, wheels) x 3 | **3 of 3 pass**; 43-49 s a run; EKF vs truth 0.11-0.40 m | 2 of 3: once the EKF never came up in 120 s; 45-46 s; 0.10-0.14 m |
| `--obstacle` (the box) | pass: 0.36 m before it, goal reached after | pass: 0.28 m |
| `--lidar-obstacle` (the post) | pass: 0.33 m | pass: 0.25 m |
| `--speed-steps`: overshoot | 15.9, 15.2, 10.1 %; within 5 % after 10.9-13.3 s | the same to 0.1 % and 0.1 s |
| Those three legs together | 4 min 5 s | 4 min 22 s |
| `--lane-only` (road) | pass: within 5 cm in 5.4 s, overshoot 3 cm | pass: 5.1 s, 5 cm |
| `measure lane`, a campus road, 120 s | 171 m, error mean 4 cm, lane lost in 0-1 % | 60 m, ended in the other lane, lost in 68 % |
| `drop-in`, road world | every camera, the lidar, the radar at 10 Hz: pass. `/perception/voxels/cubes` silent (the voxels trial is off) | not run |
| `--perception` (RF-DETR and the stop-sign lock) | **fail**: the detector saw the sign but the lock never came on while driving | pass: locked at 68 px, stood 3.9 m before it |

**The stop sign on ours, what we know:** parked 6 m from it (`start_x:=19`), RF-DETR finds
it (score 0.93, 62 px tall: the watcher wants 55) and the lock comes on. Still pictures
along the road: 0.84-0.94 from 19 m to 4 m away. Gazebo's box at the same place is taller
(68 px against our 52). While driving, the lock never came on. [[untested]] why.

### Three times each, then the switch (8 Nov, quiet Mac)

| Check, on ours | Runs | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `--perception` (RF-DETR, the stop-sign lock) | 3 | **3 of 3 pass**: locked at x = 17.7-18.2 m (56-71 px), stood 3.9-4.4 m before the sign. Before them, 4 of 5 with a listener |
| `--faults` (14 faults, the watchdog's own two) | 3 | **3 of 3**: 25 of 25 checks each |
| `--drive-to-point-only` (1 and 3 m/s, cancel, e-stop, GPS fault) | 3 | **3 of 3**: 17 of 17 checks each; B within 0.09-0.27 m |
| `--obstacle` with the box drawn in the pictures | 1 | pass: 0.35 m before it; the cameras drew it ("placed models: [obstacle]") |

**The stop sign:** the lock never came on while driving in 1 of the first 5 runs, and in
none of the next 3. A listener logged every box: a picture every 0.1 s, no gaps, the
detector's box 50 ms after each picture's stamp, growing smoothly as the car came near.
No fault found in the sign's size, height or pose, or the camera's mount; the one failure's
cause is not known. Our box is smaller than Gazebo's at the same place (52 px against 68);
the lens's own sum gives about 49 px, so ours is the nearer.

**Found and fixed on the way:** with `faults:=true` our front left camera_info went to the
relay's topic too, so `--faults` waited for the lens and failed; now only the picture moves
(`--image-topic`), as Gazebo's bridge does.

So on 8 Nov `DEFAULT_SIMULATOR` became `own`. `sim-check` says which simulator it runs, every
time (`simulator:=`).

## Results (7 Nov, Ben's Mac, other agents running: load 30-40)

| Check | Ours | Gazebo |
|---|---|---|
| `drop-in`, test lot | odom, status, IMU, GPS, radar, lidar: pass. Cameras: nothing (none yet) | pass (5 Nov) |
| A Nav2 goal, (14, 0) in the test lot | succeeded; the truth 0.4 m short, 0.9 m aside | succeeded (5 Nov) |
| `sim-check`: start-up, contract, lidar, scan, scripted drive, EKF vs truth (0.05-0.20 m), wheels vs IMU | pass | pass |
| `--lidar-obstacle` (the post) | pass: stopped 0.20 m before it | pass |
| `--obstacle` (the box) | stopped **0.33 m** before it; then the goal failed: a TF lookup ran late on the loaded Mac | 0.23 m (3 Nov) |
| `--speed-steps` (-0.5, 1, 2 m/s): overshoot | 15.8, 15.2, 10.1 %; within 5 % after 10.9-13.3 s | 15.9, 15.2, 10.1 %; 11-13 s (TODO 27) |
| `--drive-to-point`, 1 m/s | 7 of 8 pass, B within 0.11-0.34 m; the +150° leg refused (B inside the tightest turn from where the last leg stopped) | pass (0.2) |
| `--drive-to-point`, 3 m/s | 3 of 4 pass, B within 0.05-0.12 m; one leg held by the sensor watchdog (a stale sensor on the loaded Mac) | pass (0.2) |
| Real-time factor | 0.71-1.00 under that load | not run here: its renderer didn't load in this worktree |

## Not there yet

| Missing | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Hills in a world | the ground works on any mesh; none of our worlds has a slope yet |
| The car's own body in the lidar | Gazebo's lidar may see the car; ours doesn't |
| The Bevy window drawing ours | the window reads the same topics, so it works as with Gazebo; not run yet |
| `ActuatorCar` driving the node | the Python actuator model stays in front, as with Gazebo |
