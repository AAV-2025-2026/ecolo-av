# MPPI that knows the lag

Ben, 7 Nov (0.3): **"have the algorithms know about lag"**.

Nav2's MPPI plans as if the car obeys at once. It can't take our lag model without a C++
plugin, and we write no C++. So MPPI is **ported to Rust**, with the lag in its model.
Nav2 still plans the path; ours follows it. It is a **trial**, beside Nav2's MPPI.

> **The short version**
> - **Switch:** `tracker:=mppi_lag` (with `reversing:=false`). Package `aav_mppi_lag`.
> - **Same MPPI:** Nav2's sampling, critics, softmax and smoothing, nav2.yaml's numbers.
> - **New model:** ego's ramps, the spine's speed loop, the pedals' and steering's lags.
> - **Without ROS:** it predicts the car **70 times better** (8 mm off over 2.8 s, against 0.56 m).
> - **On very slow actuators** it keeps the path (0.1 m) where the lag-free MPPI **loses it**.
> - **At vehicle.yaml's guesses** both stay within a few cm: the lag is small there.
> - **Fast:** 1.7 ms a tick on an M4 Max (2000 samples x 56 steps); about 10 ms on the Orin.
> - **Gazebo:** not a fair test yet: on a loaded computer the odometry stalled and it gave up
>   ([below](#in-gazebo)); while driving it was closer to the path (0.13 m against 0.20 m).

## How it fits

```
planner (Nav2) ──path──▶ bt_navigator ──FollowPath──▶ mppi_lag ──cmd_vel_nav──▶ smoother
                                                         ▲          ──▶ collision_monitor
            odometry, /vehicle/steering, throttle, brake ┘          ──▶ twist_mux ──▶ ego
```

The same place as `aav_track`'s trackers: controller_server's `follow_path` is renamed
`follow_path_unused`. Everything after `cmd_vel_nav` is unchanged: the safety chain too.

## The model

Each sample is rolled out through this, step by step:

| Stage | What it does | From |
|---|---|---|
| ego | speed ramps at 1.0 up, 2.0 down m/s²; steering at 0.6 rad/s; holds the steering under 0.05 m/s | ego.yaml |
| speed loop | the spine's PI: throttle from the speed error, brake past a coast band, a hold brake at a stop | spine-core's `default` (as Gazebo's `SpeedLoop`) |
| dead times | each demand waits floor(t / dt + 0.5) steps | vehicle.yaml (0 until measured) |
| throttle, brake | first-order lag, exact: level += (u - level)(1 - e^(-dt/lag)) | `throttle_lag`, `brake_lag` |
| speed | max_accel x throttle - max_brake x brake - drag x v; never reverses | `max_accel`, `max_brake`, `drag` |
| steering | deadband (on the motor's setpoint), motor at most `steer_rate`, linkage lag, + offset, full lock | `steer_*` |
| pose | bicycle with the new speed and steering, at the mid-step heading | `wheelbase` |

**Where each sample starts:** the pose and speed (odometry), ego's output, the measured
steering, throttle and brake (while fresh), and **the commands already sent that are
still in their dead time**. Nav2's starts from the pose and speed alone.

### The trait: where the shared car model plugs in

Another 0.3 job builds a shared crate, `car-model` (`ros/bringup/aav_description/car-model`).
`LagModel` already follows its rules (the four rows above). Until it merges, the model sits
behind a trait (`crates/mppi-lag/src/model.rs`); at the merge, that crate implements it.

```rust
pub trait CarModel: Sync {
    type State: Clone + Send + Sync + Debug;
    fn at_rest(&self, pose: Pose, speed: f64) -> Self::State;
    fn step(&self, state: &mut Self::State, command: Command, dt: f64);
    fn observe(&self, state: &mut Self::State, seen: &Observation);
    fn pose(&self, state: &Self::State) -> Pose;
    fn speed(&self, state: &Self::State) -> f64;
    fn steering(&self, state: &Self::State) -> f64;
    fn wheelbase(&self) -> f64;
    fn lag_aware(&self) -> bool;
}
```

| Model | What | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `LagModel` | the spec above (the car behind ego) | `model: lag`, the default |
| `IdealModel` | obeys at once (Nav2's assumption) | `model: ideal`: the same MPPI without the lag, for comparison |
| `Driven<M>` | ego's ramps in front of any model | always |

## What differs from Nav2's MPPI

| | Nav2 | Ours | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Samples | (vx, wz), each step clipped to ax, az | (speed, steering), clipped to the range only | ego's ramps are in the model; Nav2's clipping drifts samples slower |
| Noise | white | **correlated**, AR(1) 0.8 | see below |
| Sent | element 1 | element 0 | the dead times already hold what was sent |
| Critics | the eight in nav2.yaml | the same eight, same weights | PathAngle forward mode only |

### Why the noise is correlated

Through a lagging steering, white noise averages away: every sample drives alike, and
MPPI learns nothing. Without ROS, on a slow car (steering 0.5 rad/s, 0.3 s lag, 0.2 s
dead time), an S-curve (2 x 16 m) at 1 m/s, mean distance off the path (measured
with the first, forward-Euler version of the model):

| Noise | Lag-aware MPPI | Lag-free MPPI |
|---|---|---|
| white (Nav2's) | **lost the path** (5.6 m off) | 0.033 m |
| correlated 0.8 | 0.036 m | 0.018 m |

So ours samples smooth wiggles (colored-noise MPPI). `noise_correlation: 0.0` gives Nav2's.

## Results without ROS

A pretend car: ego and the lag model, stepped every 0.01 s. MPPI at 20 Hz, 1000 samples.
`cargo test --release -p mppi-lag --test closed_loop -- --nocapture`.

**Prediction** (2.8 s ahead, weaving):

| Car | Lag model | Lag-free |
|---|---|---|
| vehicle.yaml | 0.022 m | 0.446 m |
| slow | **0.008 m** | 0.559 m |
| very slow | **0.004 m** | 0.708 m |

**Tracking** (mean / worst distance off the path):

| Path, car | Lag-aware | Lag-free |
|---|---|---|
| circle r 5 m, vehicle.yaml, 1 m/s | 0.015 / 0.028 m | 0.015 / 0.031 m |
| S 2 x 16 m, vehicle.yaml, 2 m/s | 0.035 / 0.087 m | 0.024 / 0.052 m |
| S 2 x 16 m, slow car, 2 m/s | 0.041 / 0.097 m | 0.021 / 0.077 m |
| corner r 4 m, **very slow** car, 2 m/s | **0.023 / 0.101 m** | 0.248 / **1.467 m** |
| S 2 x 16 m, **very slow** car, 2 m/s | **0.049 / 0.103 m** | **lost it** (4.1 / 8.0 m) |
| S 2 x 16 m, **very slow** car, 3 m/s | **0.048 / 0.107 m** | **lost it** (3.5 / 7.3 m) |

The slow car: steering 0.5 rad/s, 0.3 s lag, 0.2 s dead time. The very slow car: steering 0.3 rad/s, 0.5 s linkage lag, 0.3 s steering and 0.2 s pedal
dead times.

**Honestly:** at vehicle.yaml's guesses (0.1 s lags, no dead times) the lag is small, and
the lag-free MPPI tracks as well or 1-2 cm better (on the slow car too), but 2-4 s
slower over each route. The lag model pays off
when the actuators are slow. The real numbers come from tests 3.10-3.12 and 4.1-4.5.

## Speed

`cargo run --release -p mppi-lag --example timing` (all eight critics, a costmap):

| Threads | 2000 x 56 | 1000 x 56 |
|---|---|---|
| 16 (M4 Max) | 1.7 ms | 0.9 ms |
| 4 (the default) | 3.1 ms | |
| 1 | 12.7 ms | 6.3 ms |

The tick is 50 ms. **Orin, estimated, not measured:** its A78AE cores are about 3 times
slower than an M4's, so about 10 ms on 4 threads, 40 ms on one.

## In Gazebo

The test lot's first leg ("a left turn", 22 m), `pixi run measure controllers --tours lot
--legs 1`, 7 Nov, on an M4 Max **shared with other jobs (load 20 to 45)**:

| Run | Follower | Reached | Driven | Off the path, mean | Tick, mean / worst |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `mppi_lag` | no: Gazebo stalled 2.3 s, the geofence latched | 13.5 m | **0.13 m** | 2.5 / 13.3 ms |
| 2 | Nav2's MPPI | **yes, in 70 s** | 22.1 m | 0.20 m (worst 0.62) | (C++, not logged) |
| 3 | `mppi_lag` | no: Nav2 gave up | 2.3 m | 0.27 m | 10.3 / 41.1 ms |
| 4 | `mppi_lag` | no: Nav2 gave up | 7.4 m | **0.13 m** | 10.0 / 16.5 ms |

**Honestly: not a fair comparison yet.** Under that load the odometry stopped for 0.6 to
3.7 s at a time (the sensor watchdog's STALE lines, in every run, Nav2's too).

| On a gap in the odometry | Does |
|---|---|
| `mppi_lag` (as `aav_track`) | gives up the path after 1 s (`odom_timeout`); Nav2 retries, then gives up |
| Nav2's controller_server | reads the pose from `/tf` without an age check, and drives on |

While it drove, `mppi_lag` stayed closer to the path (0.13 m against 0.20 m). Run it again
on a quiet computer, the whole tour, both followers, before calling a winner.

## lag_aware: so ego doesn't cancel the lag twice

Ego's lead (0.3) cancels lag for drivers that don't know about it. It must turn off while
a lag-aware driver drives.

Ego's contract: `/drivers/<slot>/lag_aware`, `std_msgs/Bool`, reliable, transient local,
depth 1. This drives through Nav2's slot: `/drivers/nav/lag_aware`.

| When | Says |
|---|---|
| start, exit | `false` |
| a path starts (`model: lag`) | `true` |
| the path ends | `false` |
| `model: ideal` | always `false` |

## Run it

```sh
pixi run sim world:=test_lot reversing:=false tracker:=mppi_lag
pixi run measure controllers --trackers mppi_lag --controllers mppi --tours lot
cd ros/drivers/aav_mppi_lag && cargo test --release -p mppi-lag
```

## What is missing

| Missing | Next |
|---|---|
| The shared car-model crate | implement `CarModel` with it at merge |
| The car's real lags | tests 3.10-3.12, 4.1-4.5; then these runs again |
| The Orin's tick | measured on the Orin |
| Reversing | forward only, as every tracker |
| ego's jerk limit, sideways slow-down | not modelled (off at our speeds) |
| A fair Gazebo run | the whole lot tour on a quiet computer, both followers |
| A gap in odometry | gives up after 1 s, as `aav_track`; Nav2's MPPI drives on: decide which is right |
| A live swap | it is its own node: `tracker:=` at launch only |
