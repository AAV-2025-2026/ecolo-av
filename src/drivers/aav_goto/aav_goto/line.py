"""
Where the car is against the line to B, and how to steer onto it (pure pursuit).

No ROS here. Map frame (x east, y north), metres and radians; the pose is base_link's,
on the ground under the rear axle, which is where pure pursuit's maths puts the car.

```text
            turn: pure pursuit to B            line: pure pursuit on A -> B
   car >---.                             A ------------------x-------------> B
            `-.  (the tightest circle            carrot: lookahead m ahead on the line
               `.  ego allows)                   cross track: the car's distance from it
                 `---> lined up: A = here
```

1. **Turn**: while B is more than `align` off the car's nose, aim straight at B, at most
   at full lock. A car can't turn on the spot, so B must lie outside both of its tightest
   circles (`reachable`), or it would circle B for ever.
2. **Line**: once lined up, A is where the car was, and it follows the line A -> B. The
   carrot runs on past B, so the car keeps its heading while it stops.
