"""
Each camera's newest obstacle points, together: what camera_obstacles publishes.

No ROS imports, so the tests run anywhere.

camera_obstacles gets one detection message per picture, from whichever camera it came.
Published one camera at a time, a person behind the car would come and go with every
front picture, and collision_monitor, which keeps only a source's newest cloud, would
stop and start. So it keeps each camera's newest points and publishes them all, every
time; a camera silent for more than max_age seconds drops out (a stale picture shows
where things were, not where they are).
