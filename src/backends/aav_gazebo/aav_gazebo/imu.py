"""
The IMU's acceleration in Gazebo: what a real IMU on the car would feel. No ROS here.

Gazebo's IMU misses the car's own acceleration (found 15 Oct by the actuator tests):
Gazebo's Ackermann system drives the wheels by speed, and its IMU reads only gravity,
noise and the odd contact bump. Speeding up at 0.6 m/s^2 read 0.00 on average. So
gazebo_imu replaces the forward and sideways readings with the car's:

    forward  = dv/dt - x r^2      speeding up, braking
    left     = v r + x dr/dt      the turn's centripetal pull

v the speed, r the yaw rate, x how far the IMU sits ahead of the rear axle (imu_link,
vehicle.yaml). Up stays Gazebo's: gravity, and the bumps. v and dv/dt come from Gazebo's
odometry (Speedometer), which follows the actuator model's speed: so the IMU needs
nothing from gazebo_adapter, as a real IMU needs nothing from the car's computer.
