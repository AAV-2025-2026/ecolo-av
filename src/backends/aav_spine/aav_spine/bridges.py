"""
Which spine_bridge the launch files start, and what it does on the bus.

No ROS imports. Both are the same node, `spine_bridge`, on the same topics, with this
package's config/spine.yaml: aav_spine_bridge (Rust, T1.8) and aav_spine (Python, kept
until the Rust one has run on the car). The launch argument is `bridge:=rust|python`, in
spine.launch.py, bench.launch.py, sim.launch.py and gazebo.launch.py.

Its `role`: `spine` drives the car over CAN; `sensors` only reads the wheel nodes, and
sends nothing. car.launch.py picks it from `actuators:=`, the car's wiring
(docs/can-plan.md): `uart`, today's, where the ESP32 is driven through the Motor Pi's
UART and the Orin's CAN bus has only sensors on it; `can`, the KEFC plan's CAN spine.
