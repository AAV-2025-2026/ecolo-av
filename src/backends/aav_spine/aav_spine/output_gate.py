"""
The safety gate, as spine_bridge hears it. No ROS imports.

The output mux (aav_io_mux) says its state on /safety/output_mux/state, one line:
"OPEN - car: every source REAL", "WAIT - car: ...", "STOP - target car needs REAL - ...".
spine_bridge refuses /spine/arm unless that line says OPEN for its own target, and came
within `timeout` s (Ben, 24 Oct). Armed while the gate is shut, the spine would get no
commands, and its watchdog would only latch it again.

| The bridge's source | Its target | Its commands |
|---|---|---|
| real | car | /control/car/actuator_cmd |
| bench | bench | /control/bench/actuator_cmd |
| sim | gazebo | /control/gazebo/actuator_cmd |

Times come from a steady clock (time.monotonic), never the node's: in Gazebo that one is
simulated, and a paused simulation must not keep an old OPEN fresh.

The Rust twin is the spine-bridge crate's gate.rs; both say the same words.
