"""
CARLA's frames to ours (REP-103, REP-105). No ROS and no `carla` imports.

CARLA is Unreal Engine: a LEFT-handed frame, and degrees.

  CARLA (Unreal)                     ROS (ours)
  x forward                          x forward
  y RIGHT                            y LEFT
  z up                               z up
  pitch + = nose up      (degrees)   pitch + = nose DOWN  (radians)
  yaw   + = turn right   (degrees)   yaw   + = turn LEFT  (radians)
  roll  + = right side down          roll  + = right side down
  metres (the Python API)            metres

So a point or a velocity flips its y; an orientation keeps roll and flips pitch and yaw.
These are the same rules as CARLA's own ROS bridge (carla-simulator/ros-bridge,
carla_common/transforms.py, MIT).

The map frame: map (0, 0) is navsat.yaml's datum, x east, and the car starts there facing
east, on the bench and in Gazebo alike (the EKFs start at the origin, facing east, and
the IMU has no compass). A CARLA car starts at a town's spawn point instead, so SpawnFrame
moves and turns CARLA's world until the spawn point is the origin, facing east. GPS and
the truth are made in that frame; GPS then turns it into latitude and longitude around
the datum.

A digital twin of Carleton built around the datum (docs/carla.md) is different: its world
origin is (near) the datum already, x east. map_frame() then only moves CARLA's world by
the origin's offset, so the GPS, Nav2's maps and the map window all line up with the
streets CARLA draws.
