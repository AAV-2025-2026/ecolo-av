"""
Ego's Ackermann command as a CARLA car's controls, and back. No ROS, no `carla`.

Ego sends a speed (m/s) and the virtual centre wheel's angle (rad, + left), sized for OUR
car (vehicle.yaml: wheelbase, max_steering_angle). A CARLA car is bigger, so the same
angle would turn it on a wider circle. match_curvature() keeps the circle instead: the
CARLA car turns on the radius ours would.

Two ways to drive the CARLA car (carla_adapter's control parameter):

  ackermann  VehicleAckermannControl (CARLA 0.9.14 and later): speed, acceleration and a
             steering angle; CARLA's own speed loop works the pedals. The default.
  pedals     VehicleControl: throttle, brake and steer in -1..1, from our SpeedLoop here.
             For a CARLA version without the Ackermann controller, or to tune our own.

CARLA steers + right (Unreal's y points right); ours is + left. Both flip it here.
