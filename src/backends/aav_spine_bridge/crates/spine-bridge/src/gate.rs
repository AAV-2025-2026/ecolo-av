//! The safety gate, as the bridge hears it: the output mux's one-line state
//! (/safety/output_mux/state, aav_io_mux). The bridge refuses to arm unless the gate is
//! OPEN for its own target, and was heard recently (Ben, 24 Oct).
//!
//! Its times are a steady clock's ([`Instant`]), never the node's: in Gazebo the node's
//! clock is simulated, and a paused simulation must not keep an old OPEN fresh. The output
//! mux keeps its own time on a steady clock too.
