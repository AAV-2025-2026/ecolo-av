sensor_mux: checks that every sensor comes from the one source this run asked for.

Subscribes  system/source            aav_interfaces/DataSource, latched: who says what is
                                     REAL, SIM, BENCH or REPLAY
Publishes   system/sensor_mux/state  aav_interfaces/SourceCheck, 2 Hz: the verdict, read by
                                     the output mux

Parameters  source (real; sim, bench or replay), period (0.5 s), startup (2.0 s: silent
            while discovery settles, so the output mux waits rather than judging an
            unfinished graph), hold (5.0 s: how long a graph doubt lasts before it counts)

It moves no data. Each launch starts only the chosen source's drivers or stand-ins on the
canonical topics (/sensors/..., /vehicle/odom...); this node checks, from the ROS graph,
that each of those topics has at most one publisher, and that /system/source says it
comes from `source` (provenance.check_sensors). So the pictures and point clouds cost
nothing extra. An announcement counts while its announcer is alive, and before the graph
shows it; a node on /system/source not heard yet is a doubt (provenance.Announcers).

An announcement of another source is a problem at once. What the graph suggests is a
doubt until it has lasted `hold` s (provenance.Hold): a node can be seen publishing
before its announcement arrives, or before its name is known.
