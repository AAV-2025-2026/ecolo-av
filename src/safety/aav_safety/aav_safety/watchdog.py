"""
The sensor watchdog's logic: is each sensor alive, sane and moving? No ROS here.

sensor_watchdog (the node) tells this module what arrived and when; this module says, for
each input, OK or what is wrong, and whether the automatic drivers must stop (twist_mux's
sensors lock). READ-ME-FULL-SIMULATION.md step 6; docs/simulation.md, "Sensor failures
on purpose".

What counts as wrong, per input (each check only where its rule asks for it):

  NEVER   nothing yet
  STALE   nothing good for max_age seconds (a cable pulled, a driver dead)
  NAN     the newest message has NaN or inf in it (a driver's bad parse)
  NO FIX  a GPS fix that says it has none, or NaN: the GPS counts as lost (STALE after
          max_age), as navsat_transform ignores those fixes too
  FROZEN  the same values again and again for frozen_after seconds (a driver stuck,
          sending its last message with fresh stamps). For a camera only while the car
          moves: a still car in a still world sees the same picture. For a heartbeat: its
          count stopped rising
  JUMP    two GPS fixes further apart than max_jump_speed allows in the time between
          their stamps, plus jump_margin for the fixes' own noise. Latched: the position
          after a jump can't be trusted until a person says so (clear())
  DISAGREE  the wheels' speed or turn against the IMU's and the GPS's, where the odom
          rule has a cross_check (wheel_check.py): a wheel speed frozen while the car
          speeds up, brakes, turns or drives on faster. Latched, as a jump
  LOST    where the rule says latch (the HUD's heartbeat): the input went wrong (STALE,
          FROZEN...) after its start-up. Latched: a program that died or froze once may
          do it again, so a person looks before Nav2 drives again (clear())

The latch rule (Ben, 24 Oct: a HUD that keeps crashing holds Nav2 until a person clears
it): one dropout is forgiven while the input starts, within latch_grace seconds of its
first OK (a window opening, its first slow frames): it only holds the drivers
while it lasts, as before. Any other dropout latches LOST, even once it is back. update(),
once a tick, makes that call; after a stall of the watchdog itself (a busy computer,
SIGSTOP) it skips a tick, as the silence it sees then is its own.

A heartbeat input (kind heartbeat) is a program saying it is alive, not a sensor: the
HUD's /hud/heartbeat, the number of frames its screen has drawn. Silence (STALE, or NEVER
before its first) means the screen froze or died; a count that stops rising is FROZEN.

A detections input (kind detections) watches a camera through its detector's output: the
car's camera_stream nodes (aav_camera_stream) keep their pictures inside, and send a
Detection2DArray for every picture, boxes or none, all on one topic. Only the messages
whose header.frame_id is the rule's frame_id count, so one input watches one camera.
Silence means its stream, decoder or detector stopped; NaN, a broken detector. No FROZEN:
an empty list repeats on a clear road (a stuck Pi camera stops the stream instead).

Times are seconds on the node's clock (Gazebo's, in the simulator).
