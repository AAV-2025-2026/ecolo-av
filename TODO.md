## 23 October: what we can do without the car

Ben, 23 Oct: "yes lets use cyclone and lets add this to a list of stuff we did and the
justifications for it", and the list below. Words: `docs/history/messages-2026-10-23.md`.
The reasons for each choice: [decisions](docs/decisions.md#decided-on-22-and-23-october).

| # | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 28 | Cyclone DDS the default on every computer | ✅ `pixi.toml`, `tools/ros.sh`, `pixi run doctor`, the docs. To check at the car: it uses one network card |
| 28b | Cyclone's limit of 32 ROS programs per computer (found 23 Oct on Linux: Gazebo's 33rd, the sensor watchdog, failed) | ✅ `tools/cyclonedds.xml` raises it to 120. oirp-spss: 45 test programs, 13 refused before, 0 after; `sim-check --obstacle`, `--spine`, `--plan-around` pass, `--faults` 24 of 25 (`odom freeze`, the known flake); colcon's 4 failures there are the HUD it can't build (no libclang) |
| 29 | The GPS antenna over the rear axle in `vehicle.yaml` (x = 0) | ✅ its height still to measure (S1) |
| 30 | The wheel sensors: an Arduino sends CAN frames, the Orin decodes them (PLAN D2) | ✅ decided; the frames are `aav.dbc` 0x200, 0x201 |
| 31 | Fix the nightly Gazebo test (failed on its first night, 23 Oct) | ✅ merged: software graphics on GitHub, and the scripted drive keeps the simulator's time (task 23). First GitHub run: the night of 23 Oct |
| 32 | The 10-minute timing test (task 11), Fast DDS against Cyclone | 🔧 the tool is built (`pixi run timing-test`, branch `wt/timing-test`, not merged); the helper stopped before the runs. Next, after the reset: merge it, then run it on a quiet Mac, Cyclone and Fast DDS |
| 33 | The HUD heartbeat to the safety watchdog (PLAN T9.8) | ✅ merged: `/hud/heartbeat` at 10 Hz while the screen draws; silent 1 s, Nav2 and the AI stop (not latched); on the car by default (`watch_hud:=false` without a HUD). Questions for the team: latch it? the Flutter app and map window? Found: `sim-check --faults` `odom freeze` flaky |
| 34 | The sensor mux and output mux (PLAN T1.5, D3, S-4) | ✅ merged: `aav_io_mux`; backends read only `/control/<target>/actuator_cmd`, filled only while every source is REAL ([sources and targets](docs/sources-and-targets.md)). Questions for the team: "check, not copy" (D3); a bench with a real spine and pretend sensors; the HUD showing the gate; `spine_bridge` refusing to arm while it's shut |
| 35 | The CAN bridge (`aav_spine`) in Rust (PLAN T1.8) | ✅ merged: `aav_spine_bridge`, the default (`bridge:=python` for the old one); reads the output mux's topic, and the guard test runs against both. Untested: the Orin with real SocketCAN |
| 36 | A bandwidth budget: every sensor's rate and size, each link's load, the CAN bus load (PLAN T1.7) | ✅ merged: [bandwidth](docs/bandwidth.md), `pixi run bandwidth`, `pixi run can-load`. Raw cameras are the only risk; CAN 8.5% |
| 37 | **Compress the cameras** (Ben, 23 Oct: "Lets compress it"; [bandwidth](docs/bandwidth.md)) | ⬜ after 23:30, 23 Oct. Today: the camera Pis (Pi 5) run **MediaMTX**, RTSP on 8554: cam1 the Pi camera, cam2 `ffmpeg` from the USB camera (640x480, 30 fps); not ROS (audit 21 Oct). Plan: keep H.264 on the Pis (the Pi 5 has no hardware encoder: x264, low-latency settings), keep MediaMTX as the server; on the Orin, GStreamer with NVIDIA's hardware decoder (`nvv4l2decoder`) turns RTSP into ROS images on the Orin only, so raw pictures never cross the network; the HUD and laptops watch MediaMTX's stream (WebRTC/RTSP) directly. In Gazebo: `image_transport` compressed. Measure latency and size with `pixi run bandwidth`. **Ben, 23 Oct, evening:** both front cameras are **ribbon, on one Pi 5** (Ben, 23 Oct: "we have 2 ribbin cameras hanging off one pi"; the Pi 5 has two camera ports; one `camera_ros` per camera; the same clock stamps both, good for the stereo pair; check the audit's CAM2-PI with its USB camera) (CSI: libcamera, `camera_ros`; no MJPEG from the camera, so the Pi 5 encodes in software: measure its CPU); the Orin is **probably an AGX** (hardware encode and decode; to confirm); a **second, lower-end Orin** is coming (PLAN T1.9). **Suggested pipeline (23 Oct, to write up as `docs/camera-pipeline.md`, Proposed):** for the computers, ROS compressed JPEG from `camera_ros` on each Pi (capture time stamped, bag-recordable, the same in Gazebo) → on the Orin, one process per camera: decode (nvJPEG hardware if the CPU is short) → undistort (OpenCV) → YOLO in TensorRT → small detection messages. **Revised again (Ben: ROS cameras, or just stream both to the Orin with MediaMTX?): lean to the stream.** The camera Pi runs Debian 13 with no ROS, and MediaMTX works there today: it owns both cameras (H.264); on the Orin, one node per camera pulls the RTSP stream, decodes it in hardware (GStreamer `nvv4l2decoder`), stamps it, and feeds YOLO in the same process; people watch the same stream in a browser (WebRTC). Ribbon or USB is not certain (Ben: "it could be on a usb cable. who knows"): at the car, `rpicam-hello --list-cameras` (ribbon) and `v4l2-ctl --list-devices` then `v4l2-ctl -d /dev/videoN --list-formats-ext` (USB: if it offers MJPG or H264, the camera compresses and the Pi does nothing). Measure first: the Pi's CPU for two H.264 streams, the delay end to end, and the time stamp's error. Earlier idea: only one program can open a ribbon camera, so one owner per Pi: `camera_ros`, everything in ROS. People get a small preview topic (lower size and rate, or H.264 through `ffmpeg_image_transport`, which Foxglove/Lichtblick show) instead of MediaMTX; keep MediaMTX only if someone needs a browser view without ROS. GStreamer only where the hardware needs it; Isaac ROS (NITROS, zero copy) as the upgrade. Not OpenCV's DNN module for detection |
| 38 | **Match the plan to the car's wiring** (Ben, 23 Oct, evening; to confirm with the hardware lead) | ⬜ after 23:30. As Ben understands it: **actuators** (throttle, steering, brake) and maybe the steering-angle and brake-position sensors are on the **ESP32**, reached through the **Motor Pi** (probably serial: today's UART link, `aav_legacy`). The **CAN bus goes straight to the Orin**, not through the ESP32: the wheel encoders (the Arduino) and a few other sensors. Most sensors are on the network. So: the car's backend is `legacy_uart_bridge` on the Motor Pi (already behind the output mux), and the Rust ESP32 firmware's 100 ms timeout is on the UART link (Gate 2). On the Orin, a CAN **sensors-only** reader for 0x200/0x201 (today `spine_bridge` also sends drive commands). Update `docs/can-plan.md`, `docs/how-it-fits.md`, `aav.dbc`'s notes. Questions for the hardware lead: what else is on the CAN bus? does the ESP32 read the steering angle and brake position? is the Motor Pi to ESP32 link serial? |

## Working list, from 22 October (Claude works from this; Ben checks it in the morning)

Everything Ben asked for since 21 Oct, in one place. Progress is updated as each step lands,
and each step is committed. Ben's words: `docs/history/messages-2026-10-22.md`. The
proposal's full list: [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

**The night in one table** (22 Oct, 06:10; all in Gazebo, all pushed):

| | Result |
|---|---|
| MPPI | the default; reaches every goal of the lot tour, U-turn included when it may reverse |
| Obstacles | the planner steers round what the radar and lidar see |
| Heading | the global EKF's heading: worst per leg 7-16° (was up to 76°) |
| ego | a jerk limit; the weight model checked at 3 m/s |
| Gazebo | steering within 3% of the model; one node per sensor; `sim-check` nightly in CI (on trial) |
| ✅ Answered | Cyclone DDS: yes (23 Oct). The GPS antenna: already over the rear axle (23 Oct). Reversing: yes (22 Oct) |

| # | Task | Status | Progress |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | MPPI as a choice (`controller:=mppi`), and a script that compares it with Regulated Pure Pursuit | ✅ done | `f22dc4b8`; results in `docs/controllers.md` |
| 2 | ego knows the car's weight (181 kg) and its body | ✅ done | `7e76850f`; the centre of mass is a guess until the car is weighed (task 14) |
| 3 | The proposal as a to-do list with % done | ✅ done | `PLAN.md`, `b70300d7` |
| 4 | The AAV colour: the email's blue | ✅ done | `da411333` |
| 5 | Email Ben as work lands | 🔧 ongoing | part 1 ~01:30; part 2 ~02:50 (every goal reached; the DDS finding); part 3 ~03:20 (MPPI default; Cyclone); part 4 ~04:06 (round the box; the U-turn; the early push); part 5 04:38 (three-point turns); part 6 05:14 (jerk limit, steering check, nightly Gazebo; the part 4 time corrected); part 7 06:08 (the EKF heading; the antenna mount; part 6 corrected); part 8 06:41 (good morning: the forward U-turn still a coin toss) |
| 6 | MPPI loops at goals | ✅ fixed (`7697778f`), confirming in 8 | it now turns to the goal's heading from 2.5 m out: left turn 28 s, 21.4 m (was 58 s, 47.5 m with a loop); round the building reached. Confirm in the full comparison (task 8) |
| 7 | The corner problem (PLAN.md M8): the car stops at the building's corner | ✅ fixed | the planner's path passed 0.86 m from the corner. Now the planner's costmap inflates 3.0 m, gently (1.0), so paths keep to the middle of a lane; and it plans turns 1.25 x wider than full lock (`vehicle.PLAN_TURN_MARGIN`), so the controller has steering to spare. Lot run, 02:00: both kept clear of the building, both reached the first goal in 29 s, each reached 3 of 4 goals (were 1 and 2) |
| 17 | The car still sometimes circles a goal it just missed (a different goal each run) | 🔧 testing a fix | not the heading: the comparison now records where the global EKF put the car, and at walking pace its heading is good (worst 5°). Its **position** is up to 0.7 m off (Gazebo's GPS noise is 0.5 m), but the goal tolerance was 0.5 m: the car chased GPS noise with a loop. Tolerance now 1.0 m ("GPS without RTK is good to about a metre"); tighten with RTK. Run e, 02:20: **all 8 goals reached**, both controllers. Still extra driving on 2 legs (RPP's left turn 81 m for 21; MPPI's turn back 68 m) |
| 8 | Run the full comparison again with 6 and 7; update `docs/controllers.md` | ✅ done | 6 runs overnight (b-f); the page has the fixes, a table of runs and a picture of the best. Pushed 03:18 (815 tests pass) |
| 9 | Make MPPI the default, if it now does as well as Pure Pursuit (Ben: "I thought we decided to go mppi") | ✅ done | in every lot run MPPI did at least as well; it reached the first goal cleanly in all 4, Pure Pursuit looped there in 2 of 3 (it aims only at a point, so it arrives facing wrong). `vehicle.DEFAULT_CONTROLLER`; `controller:=rpp` for the old one. `sim-check --obstacle` passes with it. Untested on the Orin's CPU |
| 10 | **Split `gazebo_adapter` into one node per sensor**, as on the car, so each runs on its own core (Ben, 22 Oct). Rust for any part still late | ✅ done | `gazebo_imu`, `gazebo_gps`, `gazebo_radar`, `gazebo_camera` (one process each); `gazebo_adapter` keeps the car (actuators, wheels, odometry). The IMU works out the car's acceleration from Gazebo's odometry. Each sensor node takes its own `fault.<sensor>`. `sim-check` passes; `sim-check --faults`: 14 of 16, every fault reaches its node; the 2 fails were a whole-Mac stall (task 11). Not on the car: there each sensor already has its own driver |
| 11 | A long timing test (10 min, parked and driving) to catch the rare late data, before and after 10 | ⬜ | a 1 min test was clean: real time 0.99, every topic under 80 ms late. Seen since: the IMU, wheels and GPS silent 0.7-2.1 s together in MPPI's lot run (one adapter, before 10); and after 10, in `--faults`, a stall of everything at once (the global EKF missed its rate, the controller ran at 8 Hz, `map → odom` 1.4 s old). So not only the adapter: find what the whole Mac waits on. 02:13 run: IMU, wheels, both EKFs silent 0.5-0.7 s together, with the Mac 77% idle and nothing else busy: so not a CPU shortage. **Found: it's the messaging (Fast DDS), not macOS.** A bare 50 Hz publisher and subscriber beside a sim run, 25 min: the publisher's timer never slipped more than 0.03 s, a no-ROS loop 0.06 s, but the subscriber waited up to 0.48 s (9 times over 0.1 s). **Cyclone DDS: worst 0.05 s, none over 0.1 s** (25 min beside a sim run), and `AAV_RMW=cyclone pixi run sim-check --obstacle` passes everything (the rear camera at 10 Hz, 7-8 on Fast DDS). Opt-in now: `AAV_RMW=cyclone` (tools/ros.sh). ✅ **Ben, 23 Oct: "yes lets do it"**: Cyclone is the default everywhere (`pixi.toml`); `AAV_RMW=fastdds` goes back | Also seen: Spotlight (`corespotlightd`) up to 75% of a core now and then |
| 18 | Stuck facing a wall: after a loop or a wide turn the collision monitor stops the car facing a wall, and forward only it can't get out | ✅ way out on | not a false stop: at the building the car had turned toward it before passing it, and a box that bends with the steering (`VelocityPolygon`) would have bent further in. So not built. The way out is reversing (Nav2's back-up), off on the car until the team decides. With reversing, both controllers now get round every goal of the lot (run n, task 19). ⚠️ **Team: may the car reverse?** It needs something that sees behind it. **22 Oct, morning: Ben said yes, the car may reverse** (task 24) |
| 20 | Goals: a miss of heading still cost a loop | ✅ done | heading tolerance 0.5 → 0.75 rad (the EKF's heading is up to 25° off; both controllers arrived 35° off by cutting the plan's last bend). Run j, 04:03: the first two goals clean for both (29-32 s, 21-22 m; 53 s, 42 m). The U-turn failed for both: its plan is a light-bulb turn using the whole 14 m lane |
| 19 | MPPI's U-turn: forward in the 14 m lane it went wide or round the building (3 of 4 runs); with reversing, the planner drew a three-point turn but MPPI never reversed: it drove on to the far wall, stopped, and the back-up recovery failed | ✅ done with reversing | three causes, with reversing on: (1) `PreferForwardCritic` kept MPPI from backing up at all (runs h, k: 0 reversals), so it is dropped when reversing: the planner's `reverse_penalty` already decides when to reverse; (2) `PathAngleCritic` mode 2 and inversion tolerances 0.5 m / 0.6 rad, so it follows the path's own direction; (3) the progress checker cancelled the turn 10 times (rocking back and forth moves < 0.5 m): now `PoseProgressChecker`, turning 0.5 rad counts too. Run m, 04:25: turn back reached, 69 s, 2 reversals. **Run n, 04:35, whole tour: all 8 goals, both controllers.** MPPI's turn back: 71 s, 2 reversals, wide; Pure Pursuit's: 74 s, tighter, but 10 reversals and 4 stops. Forward only (run o, 04:46): the U-turn still fails for both, as before the changes: so they did no harm, and only reversing fixes it. Left: MPPI drives on a few metres before it backs up (its own choice: it asks 0.5 m/s forward, easing to 0 over 13 s). Forward only, after the EKF fix: run s (06:16) all 8 goals, the U-turn as a loop; but run t (06:26) MPPI's loop met the north wall (2 of 4), Pure Pursuit looped twice at the first goal. So forward only it's still a coin toss; reversing is the reliable way. Tried 06:35, not kept: MPPI's `az_max` 1.0 → 0.4 (to match ego's steering rate): runs u, v made the U-turn once in two, the same as before. `docs/controllers.md` |
| 16 | `sim-check`'s scripted drive came up short once (4.43 m, needs 4.5), then 5.99 m twice | 👀 watch | probably the same stalls as 11 |
| 12 | Steer round the box in the lane: sensors in the planner's map (PLAN.md M5) | ✅ done | the planner's costmap gets the radar and lidar layers (`plan_around:=true`, the default). Both controllers drove round the box 2.6-3.8 m clear. New `sim-check --plan-around` passes (3.9 m clear, no stop); the stop tests run with `plan_around:=false` and still pass (`sim-check --obstacle --lidar-obstacle`, `bench-check --obstacle`) |
| 13 | The global EKF's heading jumps at walking pace (PLAN.md M9, T6.3) | 🔧 much better |  needs a heading source; lower noise helped a little. 22 Oct, 05:30: at 0.5 m/s its heading wanders up to ±25°, forward and back alike (probe: the wheel speed and turn rates are right in reverse, so no sign bug). Over the night's runs, reversing: median 11° off, worst 76°; forward at the same speed: median 4°. **Cause of the reversing part, 05:35:** the antenna is 0.8 m ahead of the rear axle, and `navsat_transform` removes that offset with the EKF's own heading, so a heading error feeds back. Antenna over the rear axle (Gazebo, two runs each): reversing median 4.6-6.6° (was 7.5-12.8°), worst 26-31° (was 39-54°). ✅ **it is over the rear axle already** (Ben, 23 Oct); `vehicle.yaml` now says x = 0. **And in software, 05:55:** the global EKF's yaw process noise 0.06 → 0.01 (`a588a993`): heading median 2.6° off, worst 14° (was 6.2-6.7°, 39-54°); still right within 10 s of a start 29° wrong; better with a biased gyro too. Check with the real IMU's bias. Lot tour, run r (06:04): all 8 goals, worst heading per leg 7-16° (runs n, q: 14-76°) |
| 14 | Weigh the car, front and back, then with the rear lifted (M7, M7b) | ⬜ needs the team | `READ-ME-MEASURE-THE-CAR.md` |
| 24 | **The car may reverse** (Ben, 22 Oct morning: "Yes the car can reverse"), safely | ✅ done | `52d58380`: `reversing:=true` on the car, but only where the lidar sees behind it (`vehicle.blind_behind`; else forward only, with a warning). collision_monitor's stop zone turns round with the command (`velocity_polygon`): reversing, a box 1 m behind the rear bumper. `sim-check --rear-obstacle`: stopped 0.75 m short of a post, then backed on to the goal. `sim-check --obstacle` still passes (0.46 m). Seen: the Gazebo car reversed at 0.57 m/s for ego's 0.5 (its speed loop overshoots) |
| 25 | The rear camera as a sensor behind the car | ✅ wired, ⬜ untested with a real picture | the detector reads more cameras with one model (`extra_images`); camera_obstacles publishes every camera's newest points together (`aav_yolo/recent.py`), so the rear camera's don't flicker; collision_monitor stops for them (source `camera`) only with `camera_guard`, which the car sets when the rear camera watches behind: elsewhere (bench, Gazebo) no people detector feeds it, and a silent source would stop Nav2. It counts as seeing behind only when the machine's detector reads `/sensors/camera/rear/image_raw` and keeps people (`car.launch.py watches_behind`; the car's detector keeps stop signs only today). Not tried in Gazebo: it has no person to detect. Needs the cameras calibrated (Q22). Also fixed: `blind_behind` had counted camera_obstacles alone, which reads only the front camera |
| 26 | Check the nightly Gazebo job (task 23) after its first run, 03:00 on 23 Oct | ⬜ | |
| 27 | The speed loop overshoots its target by about 15% (seen: the Gazebo car reversed at 0.57 m/s for ego's 0.5) | 🔎 for T3.9, on stands | the actuator model is a port of the spine's `speed_loop.rs`, so the car would do the same with today's guessed gains: with ego's ramp, 0.5 → 0.57 m/s, 1.0 → 1.15, 2.0 → 2.20. The integral winds up while the car speeds up. Tried in the model, not kept: integrating only near the target left the car 18% short (the integral does most of the work with kp 0.3), 47% short under load. So it's tuning on stands (PLAN T3.9): until then a cap is the command, not the speed: 0.5 m/s reversing can be 0.57 |
| 23 | `sim-check` in the nightly CI (PLAN T2.6) | 👀 watch | job `sim` in `test.yml`, Linux, `sim-check --obstacle`; first run 03:00 on 23 Oct **failed**: Gazebo crashed, as EGL had no driver (no GPU, no Mesa). Fixed 23 Oct: `tools/software_gl.sh` (Mesa's llvmpipe), and the scripted drive on the simulator's time (a slow simulator cut it short); passes on oirp-spss with 4 cores, Cyclone and Fast DDS. A failure now leaves annotations and the artifact `sim-logs`. On trial (`continue-on-error`): once it passes a few nights, drop `continue-on-error` |
| 22 | Jerk limit in ego (PLAN T5.3) | ✅ done | `max_jerk` 2.0 m/s³ (`ego.yaml`): speeding up, the push builds over 0.5 s and eases off before the set speed (0 to 1 m/s in 1.5 s, was 1 s). Braking is never softened: a stop starts at once. `sim-check --obstacle` passes (stopped 0.38 m before the box) |
| 21 | Gazebo check: a 10° steer gives the predicted radius within 5% (PLAN T2.3) | ✅ done | 22 Oct, 04:55: 9.05-9.14 m for 8.90 m (+2-3%); 20° and full lock also within 3%. `docs/simulation.md` |
| 15 | Gazebo check: a tight turn at `sim_speed:=3` slows to ego's curve speed | ✅ done | asked 3 m/s at full lock: ego allowed 2.40 m/s (the computed limit), the car held 2.37-2.43 m/s with 1.9-2.0 m/s² sideways (limit 2.0); straight, 3.1 m/s. Probe: `/tmp/aav-probe/curve_probe.py` (not in git) |

## Where we stopped (15 Oct, morning)

Everything from the night of 14-15 Oct is on `main` and pushed. GitHub's Linux CI is green
again. The three branches that waited for Ben are merged (Ben, 15 Oct: "These are
important"), on the branch `merge-three-branches`, for him to bring into `main`:

| Merged 15 Oct | From | Still open |
|---|---|---|
| CAN v0.2.0: wheel frames 0x200/0x201, 100 ms timeout; `wheel-core`; wheel speed in `/vehicle/odom`, per wheel on `/vehicle/wheels` | `can-v2-work` (`wt/can-v2` was an older copy) | the wheel node boards (`boards/esp32s3-wheel`) |
| The ESP32 control board's firmware in Rust (today's UART link, CAN optional) | `wt/rust-esp32` | never flashed: `docs/esp32-bench.md` first, with Ben's go-ahead |
| One reverse speed (0.5 m/s, `vehicle.yaml`); Nav2 may reverse with `reversing:=true` (Gazebo, the bench), never on the car by default | `wt/ackermann` (its unfinished part finished) | a goal behind the car, tried in Gazebo |

**Found overnight, for Friday's audit:**
- Today's ESP32 firmware has **no command timeout, no e-stop input and no watchdog**, and an
  unprotected web update page.
- SparkFun's ESP32 MicroMod schematic shows its **CAN pads not connected**: check that the
  control board's CAN chip (U7) can reach the ESP32 before ordering the KEFC CAN parts.
- The front cameras are ribbon (CSI); our driver `usb_cam` is USB-only: `camera_ros` instead.
- A lidar is on the roof; we have a simulated one (`lidar:=true`) but no driver.

**Also landed on 15 Oct (after the summary above):**
- the two Pico 2 boards and the radar clustering in Rust; no C++ left in `src/`;
- Friday's plan, `READ-ME-FRIDAY.md`, and every hardware question, `docs/audit-questions.md`;
- the offline install kit for the car: `pixi run car-kit` (1.8 GB, untested on ARM);
- `max_speed:=` caps ego at launch, for the first drive on stands;
- plain-English driving with a local model (`pixi run -e llm talk`, Qwen3-4B), Gazebo only:
  `docs/plain-english.md`;
- better open-source models, including NVIDIA's per-pixel CitySemSegFormer, in
  `READ-ME-PERCEPTION-AND-HUD-MAP.md`.

**Checked by Ben on his Mac, 15 Oct:** the raylib HUD opens (`hud-demo`), and with the turtle it shows speed, throttle and steering live while driving from the keyboard. The car kit is made (1.8 GB, `car-kit/`).

**Next, in order:** Thursday evening, `pixi run car-kit`; Friday's audit and our stack on
the car on stands (`READ-ME-FRIDAY.md`); the A-to-B
drive (`READ-ME-A-TO-B.md`); the HUD's map panel; Python to Rust, step 1 (spine bridge, ego).

## Where we stopped (11 Oct, 12:30)

Ben, 12:27: "lets try to put everything to a reasonable state and we can audit the
hardware on friday". `main` is pushed and its tests pass. The three pieces in progress are
saved on their branches, pushed to GitHub too. Each branch's unfinished part is in its last
commit, "Work in progress".

| Branch | Done there (committed, checked) | Unfinished (its last commit) |
|---|---|---|
| `wt/sim-full` | the road world in Gazebo: lane lines, a stop sign, an obstacle, the car's camera and radar; the car's whole graph in `pixi run sim`, checked by `sim-check` | ~~the Simulation page, and a picture~~ *Done 15 Oct, with a lidar; merged into `main`* |
| `wt/ackermann` | one reverse speed for the whole car: 0.5 m/s, from `vehicle.yaml` | reversing in Nav2: behaviour trees, settings, a test |
| `wt/rust-ports` | the Rust IMU driver is the default, and the C++ one is gone | ~~the radar clustering as a Rust node (`aav_radar_clusters`)~~ *Done 15 Oct: the C++ is gone too; merged into `main`* |

**Next time, in order:**

1. **Friday 16 Oct: the hardware audit,** read-only first (`docs/work.md`, steps 1-3):
   backups, then the inventory and the measurements.
2. **Drive with W A S D,** the car or the turtle (Ben, 11 Oct). `teleop_twist_keyboard`'s
   keys are fixed (i, j, l and so on), so this is a small keyboard driver of our own, in
   the keyboard's place in the mux.
3. **Finish and merge the three branches:** each one's own checks, then `pixi run test`.
   `wt/sim-full` is merged (15 Oct).
4. **Then** the board drivers in Rust, and the raylib HUD.

## 15 Oct: all the C++ to Rust

Ben, 15 Oct: "We should port all cpp to rust", and remove the old.

- [x] **The wheel encoder and the status display Pico 2s, in Rust and Embassy**
      (`wt/rust-boards`): `boards/wheel-encoder-pico2` (same UDP packet, checked against
      the same examples as `aav_legacy`) and `boards/sentinel-pico2` (same I2C packet),
      with their logic in the crates `wheel-encoder`, `sentinel` and `hd44780`. The C++
      folders are deleted; their source stays on GitHub. *Done 15 Oct: builds, never
      flashed.*
- [x] **The radar clustering in Rust, and the IMU's C++ driver gone** (`wt/rust-ports`):
      `aav_radar_clusters` replaces `aav_object_detection` in the car, bench and Gazebo
      launch files, with the C++ node's answers for 94 clouds kept as tests. *Done 15 Oct:
      no C++ left in `src/`.*
- [ ] **Flash them** on spare Pico 2s, then on the car: `pixi run wheel-uf2`,
      `sentinel-uf2` ([Rust on the hardware](docs/rust-firmware.md)) [[needs-you]].
- [ ] **Something to feed the sentinel:** its 2025-26 sender isn't in any repo. A small
      ROS node that writes the packet over I2C (`sentinel::Telemetry::to_packet` shows the
      bytes), once we know the display is on the car (the audit).

## 14 Oct: the car in photos, the KEFC CAN plan

Ben sent 32 photos and the KEFC request (CAN bus, wheel speed, steering feedback, new GPS,
a second Orin). Pages: [car photos](docs/car-photos.md), [CAN plan](docs/can-plan.md),
[topic areas](docs/naming.md).

- [ ] **The raylib HUD** (Ben: "today maybe"). *Started 14 Oct, on `wt/hud-raylib`.*
- [x] **Topic names by area** (`docs/naming.md`). *Done 15 Oct: Decided by Ben, renamed
      everywhere (`wt/topic-areas`), checked by `tools/tests/test_topic_areas.py`.*
- [ ] **DBC v0.2.0** for the KEFC plan: the ESP32 board as the spine, wheel frames 0x200 and
      0x201, a 100 ms timeout (`docs/can-plan.md`, Proposed) [[needs-you]].
- [ ] **A lidar driver:** a lidar is on the roof; our code has none. Model at the audit.
      *A generic 16-beam lidar runs in Gazebo's road world since 15 Oct
      (`lidar:=true`), on `/sensors/lidar/points`: the real driver should publish the same.
      Nav2 reads it since 15 Oct (`aav_lidar` `lidar_scan`); then `car.launch.py lidar:=true`.*
- [ ] **The simulated lidar on by default:** off for now, as on the Mac it made the full
      graph with YOLO flaky (DDS over loopback UDP). Try Fast DDS's shared memory, or a
      smaller cloud (`docs/simulation.md`).
- [x] **Gazebo's road world on `main`** (`wt/sim-full`): the camera, radar and a roof
      lidar, with the new topic names. *Done 15 Oct: `sim-check` passes on the Mac.*
- [ ] **Friday's audit:** the checklist at the end of `docs/car-photos.md`.

## 11 Oct: what we can try at home

Ben, 03:00: "We can only do so much from home so lets focus on stuff that makes sence to
work on." His order, with the work under way:

1. [ ] **The full graph, all set up:** every driver, ego, the simulators. In Gazebo: a road
      with lane lines, a stop sign and an obstacle, a camera and a radar on the car, and
      perception, lane keeping, collision_monitor and the HUD in `pixi run sim`. *Done
      15 Oct: merged from `wt/sim-full`, with a lidar too ([Simulation](docs/simulation.md)).*
      - [ ] **The full simulation** (Ben, 15 Oct: "We want to fully simulate the car inside
            gazebo with all the sensors and build the full pipeline";
            `READ-ME-FULL-SIMULATION.md`). *Steps 1-3 built 15 Oct on `wt/full-sim-1`:
            `/system/source` and the HUD's SIMULATED banner, the per-actuator topics, the
            actuator model with guessed numbers. Steps 5 and 6 built 15 Oct: the lidar into
            Nav2, sensor failures on purpose and the sensor watchdog (`aav_safety`). Next:
            step 4, the spine in the loop.*
      - [ ] **The sensor watchdog's to-dos** (`docs/simulation.md`, "Still to do"): a lock
            that expires if the watchdog dies, frozen wheel odometry, the EKF's own guard
            against a GPS jump, the verdict on the map window, the same faults on the car.
            *Done 15 Oct, but for the car: a fail-safe lock, the wheels cross-checked with
            the IMU and the GPS, ekf_global's GPS gate (holds while the car is stopped),
            the map window's banner. Left: the cross check's limits and the faults on the
            car.*
      - [ ] **Ackermann done properly**, testable in Gazebo and on the bench: reversing
            (Reeds-Shepp), both front wheels' real angles, the steering curve from
            `Ackermann.m` (Q2). *Paused 11 Oct, on `wt/ackermann`.*
2. [x] **Our C++ to Rust:** Ben's Rust IMU driver becomes the default and the C++ one goes;
      the radar clustering becomes a Rust ROS node. Python to Rust later (Ben). *Done
      15 Oct (Ben: "We should port all cpp to rust"): `aav_imu_yahboom` and
      `aav_radar_clusters`; no C++ left in `src/`. Only the ESP32's firmware is C++.*
3. [ ] **The Mac on the network, with ML on it:** the laptop's detector (Core ML) on the
      car's compressed pictures. *On in `laptop.yaml` since 11 Oct; to try against the
      bench as the car.*
4. [ ] **Nav2:**
      - [x] the obstacle stop: a box as wide as the lane, and a re-arm after a latch, in
            `bench-check --obstacle`. *Passes on `main`, 11 Oct;*
      - [ ] N7, the weave: the bench's pretend GPS adds fresh noise to every fix, unlike a
            real receiver, whose error drifts slowly. Model it as a slow drift, then tune
            `ekf_global` for the real receiver (Q18);
      - [ ] collision_monitor flickers between stop and go at the zone's edge.
5. [x] **The board drivers in Rust, ready to try on a board:** the wheel encoder and display
      Picos (Embassy); the spine's Pico 2 program is written. *Done 15 Oct
      (`wt/rust-boards`): all three build; none flashed.*
6. [ ] **The HUD in raylib** (Ben, 11 Oct: yes): one Rust program, raylib and rclrs, that is
      also the ROS node. The driving screen first (speed, mode, the e-stop button, the
      camera); the Flutter app stays until it matches. *Started 15 Oct (branch
      `wt/hud-raylib`): the driving screen, the e-stop, GPS and topic health run on a Mac
      (`pixi run hud-demo`, `pixi run hud`). Next: the bench, a Pi, the map page.*

## Ideas to keep

- [ ] **Your Mac as the operator station** (Ben, 11 Oct): the HUD on the Mac's screen,
      driving the car from the Mac, the Core ML AI driver on the Mac, maybe all of
      perception; the Orin doing the processing when you sit at the car. *Saved, not
      started. What runs where: `docs/history/conversation.md`, 11 October.* It waits on:
      - the car on Jazzy (Q24): a Jazzy Mac can't join the car's Humble;
      - the HUD on a Mac: raylib's runs there as it is; the Flutter app needs CocoaPods;
      - the car's WiFi, measured: how late the pictures arrive, and how often it drops.
- [ ] **micro-ROS, again** (Ben, 11 Oct): "lets rethink thinks later after we see the
      hardware". No micro-ROS for now (Tentative).

## Overnight (10-10 → 10-11): all the code, then Ackermann, Rust, native style

Ben, 21:45: "Lets try to get a fully functionin gthing going on." The order of work is
Decided ([Decisions](docs/decisions.md)):

1. **The high-level pieces**, by five helpers in parallel, each on its own branch:
   - [x] **The HUD app:** an e-stop button, Cancel, the camera page, the car's status, the
         OpenStreetMap credit. Flutter 3.35.7 in `vendor/` (`pixi run get-flutter`,
         `hud-test`). *Fixed: the app could never connect (Socket.IO tried polling
         first); now WebSocket only. The back end has 98 tests.*
   - [x] **The HUD's place database:** `pixi run get-hud-map` (51 MB, checksum pinned).
   - [x] **The car's launch:** perception as parts of `car.launch.py` (camera, detector,
         stop_signs, radar_clusters), the GPS driver (`gps_driver:=ublox` by default),
         `gps:=false` fixed. *21 launch tests.*
   - [x] **The lane finder:** `aav_lane_finder`, classic OpenCV, 0.78 ms a picture.
         *`bench-check --lane`: from 0.3 m off the centre line back to within 5 cm in
         about 6 s.*
   - [x] **The spine's board program:** `boards/pico2` (Embassy), the `mcp2515` CAN driver,
         a 100 ms hardware watchdog, the e-stop's spare contact, and `pixi run spine-uf2`,
         `spine-tools`, `spine-flash`. *Builds; never flashed.*
   - [x] **Obstacles in the costmap:** the radar in Nav2's local costmap, collision_monitor,
         the camera's detections as points on the road, compressed images,
         `bench-check --obstacle`. *Merged 11 Oct.*
   - [x] **Fix the obstacle stop:** after the stop-sign drive, Nav2's recovery cleared its
         costmap and the car drove on past the box; alone, the car stopped but the spine
         latched and it never went on. *Fixed in the check, 11 Oct: the car weaves (N7), so
         the box now spans the lane; a latch from a busy computer is armed again.*
   - [x] **The `lane` part** in `car.launch.py`, off on every machine: it drives whenever
         it sees a lane.
   - [x] **The laptop's detector** (Core ML), once it reads compressed images. *On, 11 Oct.*
   - [x] **`bench-check --perception` again on a quiet Mac:** it failed 5 of 5 on a busy one.
         *Passed on `main`, 11 Oct: the car locked 4 m before the sign and went on.*
2. [ ] **Ackermann done properly:** reversing (Reeds-Shepp in Nav2), both front wheels' real
      angles in the model and RViz, and the steering motor's real curve from the
      `Ackermann.m` linkage (Q2).
3. [x] **All our C++ to Rust:** the IMU (Ben's twin becomes the default, then the C++ goes),
      the radar clustering as a Rust ROS node, the wheel encoder and display Picos (Embassy).
      *The two Picos, the IMU and the radar clustering: done 15 Oct. The Picos build, never
      flashed.*
4. [ ] **Every file in its language's own style:** `cargo fmt --check` and
      `cargo clippy -D warnings` in `pixi run test`.
5. [ ] **The whole car working, end to end.**

### Needs Ben or the team

- [ ] A spare Pico 2 and a **3.3 V** MCP2515 CAN module (for example with an SN65HVD230),
      to try the spine on a desk. The common 5 V module (TJA1050) doesn't suit a Pico 2.
- [ ] The e-stop: a photo, and where its wires go (Q6).
- [ ] The brake after boot: `IDLE_BRAKE = 0.0` lets it go; the 2025-26 firmware kept it on.
- [ ] A fresh clone on oirp-spss before anyone works there.
- [ ] Make the repo public? Checked 11 Oct: no secrets in any of its 167 commits. *Waits on Ben's
      yes, and on what to tidy first (the 11 October email).*
- [ ] The HUD on the car's Pi: Flutter has no Linux ARM download; the tile server and the
      OSRM route data.

## On Ben's Mac (10-10)

Ben's messages, word for word: `docs/history/messages-2026-10-10.md`. "Our version" is
`aav/aav` (`~/Code/aav/aav` on the Mac); this work was done in a clone at `~/aav` while that
folder downloaded, and moves into it as a fast-forward.

- [x] **Build and test on the Mac.** *`pixi run test` green after the `coreutils` fix. The
      turtle, Gazebo headless, a Nav2 goal, the Rust listener, the docs, the doctor and
      recording all run. `record.sh` now goes through `tools/ros.sh` (SIP again).*
- [x] **Email everything we talk about, in detail, with sections** (a standing request).
      *Sent at 12:16, 12:32, 12:39, and with the docs PDF.*
- [x] **Docs for a new team member:** first day, starting points, packages, work,
      decisions, infrastructure, build a driver, the costmap exercise, the older code.
      *The driver page and the costmap exercise were run as written, in a scratch copy.*
- [x] **`.gitignore` in `aav/aav`:** restored at 12:35. *The app's per-message snapshots
      were taking in the Linux `.pixi` files as scp copied them.*
- [x] **A `.gitignore` for every kind of code.** *Applied in 593db7f.*
- [x] **A `vendor/` folder** for downloaded source (Ben, 17:03): `vendor/ros2-src.repos`
      (121 repos) and `vendor/ros2-rust.repos` (9), at exact commits, in git; the 559 MB
      out of it. `pixi run vendor` downloads; `tools/test.sh` checks `COLCON_IGNORE`.
- [ ] **Prune the snapshots from `aav/aav/.git`** (149 MB down to about 1 MB)? *Ben to
      decide: it removes the app's undo points.*
- [x] **Move today's commits from `~/aav` into `aav/aav`** once the download finishes.
      *Done 16:13: the scp was still copying the server's Linux build output after six hours,
      so it was stopped and rsync brought the rest. The copy matches the server, Ben's
      uncommitted work is intact, and 55 commits fast-forwarded in. The Linux `.pixi`,
      `install` and Rust `target` went to `~/Code/aav/aav-linux-build-output`, not deleted.
      Built (25 packages, Ben's `aav_imu_yahboom` too) and tested green on the Mac.*
- [x] **Gazebo's window on the Mac:** Ben saw the screenshots (16:34).
- [ ] **Look at RViz and rqt_graph on the Mac**, and say what they show.
- [x] **The firmware requirements in `vendor/`, built out of the box** (Ben, 20:54).
      *A `firmware` environment with PlatformIO; its downloads go in `vendor/platformio/`.
      `pixi run -e firmware legacy-esp32` built today's ESP32 firmware from a clean
      checkout on the Mac (48 s). The tools to flash an ARM chip (`probe-rs`, a UF2
      converter) aren't on conda-forge: they come with the first board program.*
      *Done 11 Oct: `tools/elf2uf2.py`, and probe-rs in `vendor/cargo-tools`.*
- [x] **CARLA: 4 or 5, and do we need it?** (20:54) *Parked this year: no Jazzy
      support, no Mac version. Gazebo and bench mode cover the car graph (Q31).*
      *Reopened 15 Oct (Ben: "I think we want carla 5 not 4"): research, `carla_adapter`
      through CARLA's Python client, and Carleton's OpenStreetMap download done
      (docs/carla.md). Left: run it on the NVIDIA computer.*
- [ ] **The small fixes** listed at the end of `docs/work.md`.

## The afternoon of 10-10: "merge in all of this", then "stub in the rest"

- [x] **Perception in:** `aav_yolo` (YOLO, detections, the stop-sign watcher and its mux
      lock), `aav_object_detection` (radar clustering), `aav_lane_geometry` (lane keeping
      on `/drivers/ai/cmd_vel`), the camera calibrations in `cameras.launch.py`, the `ml` environment.
- [x] **The graph down to the sensors:** bench mode (`pixi run bench`): spine_sim runs
      spine-core on the CAN frames and drives a model car; pretend IMU, GPS, camera,
      battery and radar. `pixi run bench-check`: 7 of 7. `gps_nmea.launch.py`,
      `perception.launch.py`, udev placeholders.
- [x] **Rust drivers for the spine's devices:** jrk-g2, ad5311, pca9555, ibus, spine-board
      (98 tests); all seven firmware crates build no_std for the Pico 2 in `pixi run test`.
- [x] **The HUD's back end on our topics:** `aav_hud`, 86 tests.
- [x] **Docs:** Bench mode and Perception pages; every page brought up to date.
- [x] **Ben: commit the server work** (`aav_imu_yahboom` and its three edited files). Then
      perception and the bench become parts in `car.launch.py`'s machine files.
      *Done: the server's files are byte for byte in `dfaec15`; perception is parts
      since 11 Oct.*
- [x] **The board program for the spine's chip** (implements `spine-board`'s `Board`): waits
      on the chip (Q10-Q13). *Done 11 Oct for a Pico 2, to try on the bench.*
- [ ] **Team decisions:** the steering on an e-stop; the brake after boot; a brake on the RC
      gear switch (docs/firmware.md). *Since 11 Oct, one constant each in `spine-core`.*
- [ ] **Find `best.pt`**, the 2024-25 stop-sign model. (The 2025-26 lane finder isn't
      needed: we wrote our own, 11 Oct.)
      `best.pt` is probably on the team's Linux machine with the NVIDIA card (Ben, 10 Oct).
      No SSH to it today: later, once all the code is in place (Ben, 21:14).
- [x] **The HUD app's small changes** (docs/hud.md). *Done 11 Oct.*
- [ ] **Tune the speed loop on the car:** on the bench it trails a ramp by about a second.
- [x] **The first-day steps in `README.md`** (Ben, 17:03).
- [x] **`~/Code/aav/CLAUDE.md`:** every old folder, and what replaced it in `aav` (Ben, 17:03).
- [x] **An MCP server** (Ben, 17:03): read-only, over stdio. `tools/mcp_server.py`, `.mcp.json`
      and `docs/mcp.md`: 9 tools. Its smoke test reads a live topic.
- [x] **On GitHub** (Ben): `git@github.com:zander1976/aav.git`, private. CI: Linux on every push, a
      Mac every night. Commit messages give the intention, with no attribution lines; the
      README's Credits section covers who did what.
- [x] **Ben's Rust IMU driver** (`aav_imu_yahboom`, then `imu_driver:=rust`): reviewed and
      committed; its tests now run in `pixi run test`. *The only IMU driver since 15 Oct.*
- [x] **Cleaned up** (Ben approved): `~/aav`, the Linux build output and the old bundle.
- [ ] **Slim per-machine Pixi environments** (Orin, Motor Pi, laptop): at Phase 0.
- [ ] **An audit on the car's network** (Ben, 16:42: "at some point"): a read-only audit of
      the hardware. *Ready: the stand-ins stay on their own computer (`tools/ros.sh
      --local`, checked by `tools/test.sh`), so nothing pretend can reach the car.*

## The first night (10-09 → 10-10)

Ben's messages, word for word: `docs/history/messages-2026-10-09.md`.

- [x] **Build on this machine** with Pixi + RoboStack Jazzy (no admin, no Homebrew).
      `colcon build`, `colcon test`, then run `turtle.launch.py` headless and drive it.
      If something can't build, write down why.
      *Done: all 19 packages build in 11 s; our tests pass; the turtle drives through
      mux → ego; check_graph: 0 failures. The inherited packages' lint failures were
      fixed on 10-10.*
- [x] **Mac tomorrow.** The same `pixi.toml` for macOS (Apple Silicon). Check that every
      package resolves for `osx-arm64`. Write the steps: no Homebrew.
      *Done 10-10 on Ben's Mac (Apple Silicon, macOS 27): build 18 s, `pixi run test` all
      green after one fix (GNU `coreutils`: SIP drops `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`). See below.*
- [x] **Port everything to Jazzy as is.** Apply the fixes the audits found (configs,
      inherited code, missing dependencies). Reports: `docs/history/audit-2026-10-10-*.md`.
      - ~~Spine safety, before any firmware is written~~ *Done 10-10: B1 arming always
        sends the 0→1 edge; B2 the spine boots latched; W1 `cmd_timeout` 0.1; W2 driver
        faults stop and latch; W3 `max_decel` 2.5. Each has a test (Rust 47, bridge 4).*
      - ~~Legacy path~~ *Done 10-10: `to_legacy` evens out the steering gain; `encoder_udp`
        goes quiet after 0.3 s without packets; it runs on the Motor Pi, where the
        Pico sends.*
      - ~~pixi.toml deps; inherited packages~~ *Done 10-10: flask, flask-socketio, scipy,
        topic_tools added for all 3 platforms. Radar, battery and IMU code restyled to
        ROS's lint rules and fixed (no `sudo chmod`, udev port names, clean shutdown);
        maincar's NameErrors and start-up fixed; CMake 3.10; `.warning(`. `pixi run test`
        is all green (colcon test: 77, 0 failures).*
      - ~~Live check of sim, car and replay~~ *Done 10-10: every config key is declared
        by its Jazzy node. Fixed: Nav2 on sim time, the sim GPS noise (degrees, not
        metres), a map on the car, steering speed and inflation in the sim, a replay
        profile. Nav2 goals now succeed in Gazebo. Left for the team: see below.*
- [x] **The graph.** Every topic has the right publisher, subscriber, type and QoS.
      Check it live with `tools/check_graph.py` on the turtle run.
      *Done 10-10: turtle, sim and replay have 0 failures. The car, with no hardware,
      fails only on `/sensors/imu/data_raw` and `/sensors/gps/fix`. No QoS mismatches.*
- [x] **Docs as HTML (and PDF)**, short pages, sections, red and white, a picture of how
      it fits together. Markdown stays as the source.
      *Done: `docs/html/index.html` and `pixi run docs` (PDF). Four pictures; pages for
      each point below.*
      - What ROS 2 is, and how we extend it (stock modules vs our nodes)
      - How Python, C++ and Rust fit into Jazzy, and what we give up with Rust
      - How the dual EKF works ("local injects, global reads local + GPS")
      - Run it: turtle, keyboard, Gazebo
      - src vs firmware; one interface, several drivers (the IMU example)
- [x] **Email progress** to cmail, red and white, every few hours and when something lands.
      *Sent at 22:49, 03:50, 04:07 (the morning summary, with the PDF) and 04:17 (the car
      must run Jazzy before a Mac can join it).*
- [x] **Naming and code style** for all code. Inherited code is ours to edit now.
      *Done: `docs/conventions.md`, `pixi run lint` passes. Renaming the inherited
      packages is proposed and waits for the team.*
- [x] **Rust:** pull `rclrs` and the message crates through cargo. Build one example in
      the Pixi environment. Write down what a Rust rewrite would take (ESP32, Pi).
      *Done: `examples/rust-listener` (rclrs 0.8 + ros-env 0.3 from crates.io; the
      message code ships with Jazzy) builds in 18 s and printed ego's commands live.
      `pixi run rust-listener`. The rewrite trade-offs are in docs/languages.md.*
- [x] **Design doc:** fix the ten "last year's", and update the tree, profiles and decisions.
      *Done 10-10 (doc rev 58): all ten now name 2024-25; the tree, the four profiles,
      the mux priorities, the tests, Gazebo before CARLA; Jazzy, one repo and Languages
      marked Decided; new rows: Macs (Decided), bare metal waits (Tentative), spine
      arming (Proposed).*
- [x] **CLAUDE.md:** record tonight's decisions, so no session starts from scratch.
      *Done: docs for a dyslexic reader, Macs first-class, `pixi run test` green, test
      isolation, the pytest skip trap, Rust nodes later, where the TODO and audits live.*

## Questions Ben asked

*Answered in the morning email and in the docs: `run.md`, `languages.md`, `mac.md`.*

- Is `aav_turtlesim` different from the regular turtlesim?
- What languages are used now, and should everything be Rust?
- Can it compile on a Mac without Homebrew?
- What does the claude.ai chat (fe09d020…) say? It can't be opened from here, so Ben
  needs to paste the key parts.

## For the team to decide

- **`ROS_DOMAIN_ID`** for the car and every laptop (any number 0–101 that no one nearby uses).
- **Spine arming rules** (design doc, Proposed): boot latched, arm on a 0→1 edge.
- **Move the car to Jazzy** before a laptop can join it (Humble and Jazzy don't mix):
  try Pixi on today's Ubuntu 22.04 first, then reflash the Orin to JetPack 7.2 after a
  backup (`docs/platforms.md`).
- **GPS driver** (B4): `ublox_gps` (in Pixi) is the default since 11 Oct, Tentative.
  `gps_driver:=ublox_dgnss` (apt, the car only) stays an option.
- **N2:** twist_mux hears `/safety/estop` best-effort, and the joystick sends it once per press.
  The backends still brake. Send it repeatedly, or make the mux reliable?
- **N3:** no `respawn` on device nodes, and Nav2 gives up without TF. Add respawn?
- **N7:** Nav2's turn command flips sign about once a second in the sim. Try a longer
  lookahead.

## Decided on the first night

- Teleop (keyboard, joystick, remote) is a **driver**: it feeds the mux, then ego, then
  the turtle or the car.
- **Bare metal: wait.** Only the spine firmware is bare metal.
- **Port to Jazzy as is first**, then consider rewriting in Rust.
- **Simulator:** start with a Gazebo test world.
- **Docs:** short, sectioned, HTML or PDF. Ben is dyslexic, so use tables and pictures
  over walls of text.

## Later

- Rewrite parts in Rust: now step 3 of the order of work, at the top.
- Measure the car and replace every guessed number in `vehicle.yaml`.
- Rotate the leaked secrets, and back up the Orin and Pis before any reflash.
- Answer Q1–Q34 with the team.
